CVE-2024-7543,oFono SimToolKit Heap-based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of oFono. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute code on the target modem in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of STK command PDUs.

CVE-2023-44393,Piwigo is an open source photo gallery application. Prior to version 14.0.0beta4 a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is in the` /admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JS code into the HTML page which could then be executed by admin users when they visit the URL with the payload. The vulnerability is caused by the insecure injection of the `plugin_id` value from the URL into the HTML page. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains a specially crafted `plugin_id` value. When a victim who is logged in as an administrator visits this URL the malicious code will be injected into the HTML page and executed. This vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who has access to a malicious URL. However only users who are logged in as administrators are affected. This is because the vulnerability is only present on the `/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page which is only accessible to administrators. Version 14.0.0.beta4 contains a patch for this issue.,9.3,CWE-79

CVE-2021-43848,h2o is an open source http server. In code prior to the `8c0eca3` commit h2o may attempt to access uninitialized memory. When receiving QUIC frames in certain order HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o can be misguided to treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that have been received. When h2o is used as a reverse proxy an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by the attacker or third party. Also if there is an HTTP endpoint that reflects the traffic sent from the client an attacker can use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o. This internal state includes traffic of other connections in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets. This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the released versions of h2o are affected by this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds. Users of unreleased versions of h2o using HTTP/3 are advised to upgrade immediately.,7.4,CWE-908

CVE-2022-48731,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/kmemleak: avoid scanning potential huge holes  When using devm_request_free_mem_region() and devm_memremap_pages() to add ZONE_DEVICE memory if requested free mem region's end pfn were huge(e.g. 0x400000000) the node_end_pfn() will be also huge (see move_pfn_range_to_zone()).  Thus it creates a huge hole between node_start_pfn() and node_end_pfn().  We found on some AMD APUs amdkfd requested such a free mem region and created a huge hole.  In such a case following code snippet was just doing busy test_bit() looping on the huge hole.    for (pfn = start_pfn; pfn < end_pfn; pfn++) { 	struct page *page = pfn_to_online_page(pfn); 		if (!page) 			continue; 	...   }  So we got a soft lockup:    watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#6 stuck for 26s!

CVE-2024-46744,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Squashfs: sanity check symbolic link size  Syzkiller reports a KMSAN: uninit-value in pick_link bug.  This is caused by an uninitialised page which is ultimately caused by a corrupted symbolic link size read from disk.  The reason why the corrupted symlink size causes an uninitialised page is due to the following sequence of events:  1. squashfs_read_inode() is called to read the symbolic    link from disk.  This assigns the corrupted value    3875536935 to inode->i_size.  2. Later squashfs_symlink_read_folio() is called which assigns    this corrupted value to the length variable which being a    signed int overflows producing a negative number.  3. The following loop that fills in the page contents checks that    the copied bytes is less than length which being negative means    the loop is skipped producing an uninitialised page.  This patch adds a sanity check which checks that the symbolic link size is not larger than expected.  --  V2: fix spelling mistake.,7.8,CWE-59

CVE-2025-24019,YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5 it is possible for any authenticated user through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.,7.1,CWE-22

CVE-2025-6670,A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to the use of the HTTP GET method for state-changing operations within admin services specifically in the event processor of the Carbon console. Although the SameSite=Lax cookie attribute is used as a mitigation it is ineffective in this context because it allows cookies to be sent with cross-origin top-level navigations using GET requests.  A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a crafted link leading the browser to issue unintended state-changing requests. Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized operations such as data modification account changes or other administrative actions. According to WSO2 Secure Production Guidelines exposure of Carbon console services to untrusted networks is discouraged which may reduce the impact in properly secured deployments.,8.8,CWE-352

CVE-2022-36065,GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29 attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string.
