CVE-2023-22466,Tokio is a runtime for writing applications with Rust. Starting with version 1.7.0 and prior to versions 1.18.4 1.20.3 and 1.23.1 when configuring a Windows named pipe server setting `pipe_mode` will reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previously configured `reject_remote_clients` to `true` this effectively undoes the configuration. Remote clients may only access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publicly shared folder (SMB). Versions 1.23.1 1.20.3 and 1.18.4 have been patched. The fix will also be present in all releases starting from version 1.24.0. Named pipes were introduced to Tokio in version 1.7.0 so releases older than 1.7.0 are not affected. As a workaround ensure that `pipe_mode` is set first after initializing a `ServerOptions`.,5.4,CWE-665

CVE-2024-35902,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/rds: fix possible cp null dereference  cp might be null calling cp->cp_conn would produce null dereference  [Simon Horman adds:]  Analysis:  * cp is a parameter of __rds_rdma_map and is not reassigned.  * The following call-sites pass a NULL cp argument to __rds_rdma_map()    - rds_get_mr()   - rds_get_mr_for_dest  * Prior to the code above the following assumes that cp may be NULL   (which is indicative but could itself be unnecessary)  	trans_private = rs->rs_transport->get_mr( 		sg nents rs &mr->r_key cp ? cp->cp_conn : NULL 		args->vec.addr args->vec.bytes 		need_odp ? ODP_ZEROBASED : ODP_NOT_NEEDED);  * The code modified by this patch is guarded by IS_ERR(trans_private)   where trans_private is assigned as per the previous point in this analysis.    The only implementation of get_mr that I could locate is rds_ib_get_mr()   which can return an ERR_PTR if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.  * ret is set to PTR_ERR(trans_private).   rds_ib_get_mr can return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.   Thus ret may be -ENODEV in which case the code in question will execute.  Conclusion: * cp may be NULL at the point where this patch adds a check;   this patch does seem to address a possible bug,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-32883,MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bits microcontrollers. MCUboot uses a TLV (tag-length-value) structure to represent the meta data associated with an image.  The TLVs themselves are divided into two sections a protected and an unprotected section. The protected TLV entries are included as part of the image signature to avoid tampering. However the code does not distinguish which TLV entries should be protected or not so it is possible for an attacker to add unprotected TLV entries that should be protected. Currently the primary protected TLV entries should be the dependency indication and the boot record. An injected dependency value would primarily result in an otherwise acceptable image being rejected. A boot record injection could allow fields in a later attestation record to include data not intended which could cause an image to appear to have properties that it should not have. As a workaround disable the boot record functionality. ,7.7,CWE-354

CVE-2022-3204,A vulnerability named 'Non-Responsive Delegation Attack' (NRDelegation Attack) has been discovered in various DNS resolving software. The NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a considerable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts by querying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive nameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can trigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually look in the cache for resolved NS records in that delegation. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in orchestrated attacks. Unbound does not suffer from high CPU usage but resources are still needed for resolving the malicious delegation. Unbound will keep trying to resolve the record until hard limits are reached. Based on the nature of the attack and the replies different limits could be reached. From version 1.16.3 on Unbound introduces fixes for better performance when under load by cutting opportunistic queries for nameserver discovery and DNSKEY prefetching and limiting the number of times a delegation point can issue a cache lookup for missing records.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2023-43631, On boot the Pillar eve container checks for the existence and content of “/config/authorized_keys”.  If the file is present and contains a supported public key the container will go on to open port 22 and enable sshd with the given keys as the authorized keys for root login.  An attacker could easily add their own keys and gain full control over the system without triggering the “measured boot” mechanism implemented by EVE OS and without marking the device as “UUD” (“Unknown Update Detected”).  This is because the “/config” partition is not protected by “measured boot” it is mutable and it is not encrypted in any way.     An attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values thus not triggering the “measured boot” mechanism and having full access to the vault.    Note:  This issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure to Zededa) where the config partition measurement was added to PCR13:  • aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141  • 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.

CVE-2024-32462,Flatpak is a system for building distributing and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9 1.12.9 1.14.6 and 1.15.8 a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=` such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap` and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap` which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8 1.10.9 1.12.9 and 1.14.6.,8.4,CWE-88

CVE-2024-27392,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme: host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()  When nvme_identify_ns() fails it frees the pointer to the struct nvme_id_ns before it returns. However ns_update_nuse() calls kfree() for the pointer even when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in KASAN double-free which was observed with blktests nvme/045 with proposed patches [1] on the kernel v6.8-rc7. Fix the double-free by skipping kfree() when nvme_identify_ns() fails.,7.8,CWE-415
