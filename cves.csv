CVE-2024-32468,Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript written in rust. Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities existed in the `deno_doc` crate which lead to Self-XSS with deno doc --html. 1.) XSS in generated `search_index.js` `deno_doc` outputs a JavaScript file for searching. However the generated file used `innerHTML` on unsanitzed HTML input. 2.) XSS via property method and enum names `deno_doc` did not sanitize property names method names and enum names. The first XSS most likely didn't have an impact since `deno doc --html` is expected to be used locally with own packages.,5.4,CWE-79
CVE-2024-49796,IBM ApplinX 11.1 could allow a remote attacker to hijack the clicking action of the victim. By persuading a victim to visit a malicious Web site a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to hijack the victim's click actions and possibly launch further attacks against the victim.,5.4,CWE-1021
CVE-2024-28244,KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\def` or `\newcommand` that causes a near-infinite loop despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX supports an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. Unfortunately support for Unicode (sub|super)script characters allows an attacker to bypass this limit. Each sub/superscript group instantiated a separate Parser with its own limit on macro executions without inheriting the current count of macro executions from its parent. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10.,6.5,CWE-674

CVE-2024-53201,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe  This commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in dcn20_program_pipe(). Previously commit 8e4ed3cf1642 (drm/amd/display: Add null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe) partially fixed the null pointer dereference issue. However in dcn20_update_dchubp_dpp() the variable pipe_ctx is passed in and plane_state is accessed again through pipe_ctx. Multiple if statements directly call attributes of plane_state leading to potential null pointer dereference issues. This patch adds necessary null checks to ensure stability.,5.5,CWE-476
