CVE,Description,CVSS3_BaseScore,CWE
CVE-2024-2359,A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.3 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and execute arbitrary code. The issue arises from the application's handling of the `/execute_code` endpoint which is intended to be blocked from external access by default. However attackers can exploit the `/update_setting` endpoint which lacks proper access control to modify the `host` configuration at runtime. By changing the `host` setting to an attacker-controlled value the restriction on the `/execute_code` endpoint can be bypassed leading to remote code execution. This vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command (`Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command`).,9.8,CWE-78

CVE-2022-41874,Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. In versions prior to 1.0.7 and 1.1.2 Tauri is vulnerable to an Incorrectly-Resolved Name. Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality it is possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope definition. It is not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths as the issue is limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed paths. The impact differs on Windows MacOS and Linux due to different specifications of valid path characters. This bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files as user selected paths are automatically added to the allow list at runtime. A successful bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files. The issue has been patched in versions 1.0.7 1.1.2 and 1.2.0. As a workaround disable the dialog and fileDropEnabled component inside the tauri.conf.json.,2.6,CWE-668

CVE-2024-36422,Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 1.4.3 of Flowise a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs in the `api/v1/chatflows/id` endpoint. If the default configuration is used (unauthenticated) an attacker may be able to craft a specially crafted URL that injects Javascript into the user sessions allowing the attacker to steal information create false popups or even redirect the user to other websites without interaction. If the chatflow ID is not found its value is reflected in the 404 page which has type text/html. This allows an attacker to attach arbitrary scripts to the page allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information. This XSS may be chained with the path injection to allow an attacker without direct access to Flowise to read arbitrary files from the Flowise server. As of time of publication no known patches are available.,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2022-39273,FlyteAdmin is the control plane for the data processing platform Flyte. Users who enable the default Flyte’s authorization server without changing the default clientid hashes will be exposed to the public internet. In an effort to make enabling authentication easier for Flyte administrators the default configuration for Flyte Admin allows access for Flyte Propeller even after turning on authentication via a hardcoded hashed password. This password is also set on the default Flyte Propeller configmap in the various Flyte Helm charts. Users who enable auth but do not override this setting in Flyte Admin’s configuration may unbeknownst to them be allowing public traffic in by way of this default password with attackers effectively impersonating propeller. This only applies to users who have not specified the ExternalAuthorizationServer setting. Usage of an external auth server automatically turns off this default configuration and are not susceptible to this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.44. Users should manually set the staticClients in the selfAuthServer section of their configuration if they intend to rely on Admin’s internal auth server. Again users who use an external auth server are automatically protected from this vulnerability.,4.8,CWE-798

CVE-2025-27787,Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) in restart.py. `model_name` in train.py takes user input and passes it to the `stop_train` function in restart.py which uses it construct a path to a folder with `config.json`. That `config.json` is opened and the list of values under process_pids are read. Next all the process IDs listed in the JSON are killed. Using one of the arbitrary file writes one can  write to `logs/foobar` a `config.json` file which contains a list of process IDs. Then one can access this endpoint to kill these processes. Since an attacker can't know what process is running on which process ID they can send a list of hundreds of process IDs which can kill the process that applio is using to run as well as other potentially important processes which leads to DoS. Note that constructing a path with user input also enables path traversal. For example by supplying ../../ in `model_name` one can access `config.json` freom locations two folders down on the server. As of time of publication no known patches are available.,7.5,CWE-22

CVE-2025-21996,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/radeon: fix uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()  On the off chance that command stream passed from userspace via ioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly crafted and first command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001) the function in question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with size argument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically 'size' will point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to be assigned any value.  Play it safe and init 'tmp' with 0 thus ensuring that radeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.

CVE-2021-47389,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: fix missing sev_decommission in sev_receive_start  DECOMMISSION the current SEV context if binding an ASID fails after RECEIVE_START.  Per AMD's SEV API RECEIVE_START generates a new guest context and thus needs to be paired with DECOMMISSION:       The RECEIVE_START command is the only command other than the LAUNCH_START      command that generates a new guest context and guest handle.  The missing DECOMMISSION can result in subsequent SEV launch failures as the firmware leaks memory and might not able to allocate more SEV guest contexts in the future.

CVE-2024-8901,The  AWS ALB Route Directive Adapter For Istio repo https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio/tree/master  provides an OIDC authentication mechanism that was integrated into the open source Kubeflow project. The adapter uses JWT for authentication but lacks proper signer and issuer validation.

CVE-2024-43805,jupyterlab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing based on the Jupyter Notebook Architecture. This vulnerability depends on user interaction by opening a malicious notebook with Markdown cells or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature. A malicious user can access any data that the attacked user has access to as well as perform arbitrary requests acting as the attacked user. JupyterLab v3.6.8 v4.2.5 and Jupyter Notebook v7.2.2 have been patched to resolve this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no workaround for the underlying DOM Clobbering susceptibility. However select plugins can be disabled on deployments which cannot update in a timely fashion to minimise the risk. These are: 1. `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability to preview mathematical equations. 2. `@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability to open Markdown previews. 3. `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin` (if installed with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package) - an older version of the mathjax plugin for JupyterLab 4.x. To disable these extensions run: ```jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin && jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin && jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin ``` in bash.,7.6,CWE-79
