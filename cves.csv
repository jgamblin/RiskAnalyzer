CVE-2023-52498,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code  It is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core code deadlocks because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a requisite supplier device's one for example).  Address this by changing the code in question to use async_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly run them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-26995,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: tcpm: Correct the PDO counting in pd_set  Off-by-one errors happen because nr_snk_pdo and nr_src_pdo are incorrectly added one. The index of the loop is equal to the number of PDOs to be updated when leaving the loop and it doesn't need to be added one.  When doing the power negotiation TCPM relies on the nr_snk_pdo as the size of the local sink PDO array to match the Source capabilities of the partner port. If the off-by-one overflow occurs a wrong RDO might be sent and unexpected power transfer might happen such as over voltage or over current (than expected).  nr_src_pdo is used to set the Rp level when the port is in Source role. It is also the array size of the local Source capabilities when filling up the buffer which will be sent as the Source PDOs (such as in Power Negotiation). If the off-by-one overflow occurs a wrong Rp level might be set and wrong Source PDOs will be sent to the partner port. This could potentially cause over current or port resets.,7.8,CWE-193

CVE-2025-66524,Apache NiFi 1.20.0 through 2.6.0 include the GetAsanaObject Processor which requires integration with a configurable Distribute Map Cache Client Service for storing and retrieving state information. The GetAsanaObject Processor used generic Java Object serialization and deserialization without filtering. Unfiltered Java object deserialization does not provide protection against crafted state information stored in the cache server configured for GetAsanaObject. Exploitation requires an Apache NiFi system running with the GetAsanaObject Processor and direct access to the configured cache server. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.7.0 is the recommended mitigation which replaces Java Object serialization with JSON serialization. Removing the GetAsanaObject Processor located in the nifi-asana-processors-nar bundle also prevents exploitation.,8.8,CWE-502

CVE-2025-37929,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: errata: Add missing sentinels to Spectre-BHB MIDR arrays  Commit a5951389e58d (arm64: errata: Add newer ARM cores to the spectre_bhb_loop_affected() lists) added some additional CPUs to the Spectre-BHB workaround including some new arrays for designs that require new 'k' values for the workaround to be effective.  Unfortunately the new arrays omitted the sentinel entry and so is_midr_in_range_list() will walk off the end when it doesn't find a match. With UBSAN enabled this leads to a crash during boot when is_midr_in_range_list() is inlined (which was more common prior to c8c2647e69be (arm64: Make  _midr_in_range_list() an exported function)):   |  Internal error: aarch64 BRK: 00000000f2000001 [#1] PREEMPT SMP  |  pstate: 804000c5 (Nzcv daIF +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)  |  pc : spectre_bhb_loop_affected+0x28/0x30  |  lr : is_spectre_bhb_affected+0x170/0x190  | [...]  |  Call trace:  |   spectre_bhb_loop_affected+0x28/0x30  |   update_cpu_capabilities+0xc0/0x184  |   init_cpu_features+0x188/0x1a4  |   cpuinfo_store_boot_cpu+0x4c/0x60  |   smp_prepare_boot_cpu+0x38/0x54  |   start_kernel+0x8c/0x478  |   __primary_switched+0xc8/0xd4  |  Code: 6b09011f 54000061 52801080 d65f03c0 (d4200020)  |  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---  |  Kernel panic - not syncing: aarch64 BRK: Fatal exception  Add the missing sentinel entries.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-43634, When sealing/unsealing the “vault” key a list of PCRs is used which defines which PCRs are used.  In a previous project CYMOTIVE found that the configuration is not protected by the secure boot and in response Zededa implemented measurements on the config partition that was mapped to PCR 13.  In that process PCR 13 was added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key.  In commit “56e589749c6ff58ded862d39535d43253b249acf” the config partition measurement moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14 but PCR 14 was not added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key.  This change makes the measurement of PCR 14 effectively redundant as it would not affect the sealing/unsealing of the key.    An attacker could modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot this could result in the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents of the encrypted “vault”     ,8.8,CWE-522

CVE-2025-54123,Hoverfly is an open source API simulation tool. In versions 1.11.3 and prior the middleware functionality in Hoverfly is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability at `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware` endpoint due to insufficient validation and sanitization in user input. The vulnerability exists in the middleware management API endpoint `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware`. This issue is born due to combination of three code level flaws: Insufficient Input Validation in middleware.go line 94-96; Unsafe Command Execution in local_middleware.go line 14-19; and Immediate Execution During Testing in hoverfly_service.go line 173. This allows an attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) on any system running the vulnerable Hoverfly service. Since the input is directly passed to system commands without proper checks an attacker can upload a malicious payload or directly execute arbitrary commands (including reverse shells) on the host server with the privileges of the Hoverfly process. Commit 17e60a9bc78826deb4b782dca1c1abd3dbe60d40 in version 1.12.0 disables the set middleware API by default and subsequent changes to documentation make users aware of the security changes of exposing the set middleware API.,9.8,CWE-20

CVE-2021-28715,Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data but those can be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot which may be the case when using GSO XDP or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714),6.5,CWE-770
CVE-2024-34077,MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker. Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account if the victim has an incomplete request pending. The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened and the user did not complete the process by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround one may mitigate the risk by reducing the verification token's validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in `constants_inc.php`).,7.3,CWE-305
