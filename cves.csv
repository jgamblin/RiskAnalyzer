CVE-2025-29923,go-redis is the official Redis client library for the Go programming language. Prior to 9.5.5 9.6.3 and 9.7.3 go-redis potentially responds out of order when `CLIENT SETINFO` times out during connection establishment. This can happen when the client is configured to transmit its identity there are network connectivity issues or the client was configured with aggressive timeouts. The problem occurs for multiple use cases. For sticky connections you receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the connection. All commands in the pipeline receive incorrect responses. When used with the default ConnPool once a connection is returned after use with ConnPool#Put the read buffer will be checked and the connection will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means that at most one out-of-order response before the connection is discarded. This issue is fixed in 9.5.5 9.6.3 and 9.7.3. You can prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag DisableIndentity to true when constructing the client instance.,3.7,CWE-20

CVE-2022-39206,Onedev is an open source self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. When using Docker-based job executors the Docker socket (e.g. /var/run/docker.sock on Linux) is mounted into each Docker step. Users that can define and trigger CI/CD jobs on a project could use this to control the Docker daemon on the host machine. This is a known dangerous pattern as it can be used to break out of Docker containers and in most cases gain root privileges on the host system. This issue allows regular (non-admin) users to potentially take over the build infrastructure of a OneDev instance. Attackers need to have an account (or be able to register one) and need permission to create a project. Since code.onedev.io has the right preconditions for this to be exploited by remote attackers it could have been used to hijack builds of OneDev itself e.g. by injecting malware into the docker images that are built and pushed to Docker Hub. The impact is increased by this as described before. Users are advised to upgrade to 7.3.0 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,9.9,CWE-610

This makes it possible for attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server which can contain sensitive information and to upload files into directories other than the intended directory for file uploads. The free version requires Administrator access for this vulnerability to be exploitable. The Pro version allows a file manager to be embedded via a shortcode and also allows admins to grant file handling privileges to other user levels which could lead to this vulnerability being exploited by lower-level users.,9.9,CWE-22

CVE-2024-43863,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling  Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove the fence from the pending list and thus doesn't require a lock to fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.  vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all fences and update their status to do that it holds a lock to prevent the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending fences for which it holds a lock.  dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll calls the wait which signals the fences which are being destroyed. The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it was called.  Old bug but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling interfaces. Fix those in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-50145,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()  build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.  __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb allocation fails keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case don't process the packets and don't push them up the network stack - they are skipped.  Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-4598,A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump allowing the attacker to read sensitive data such as /etc/shadow content loaded by the original process.  A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary affecting data confidentiality.,4.7,CWE-364

CVE-2025-21867,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf test_run: Fix use-after-free issue in eth_skb_pkt_type()  KMSAN reported a use-after-free issue in eth_skb_pkt_type()[1]. The cause of the issue was that eth_skb_pkt_type() accessed skb's data that didn't contain an Ethernet header. This occurs when bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() passes an invalid value as the user_data argument to bpf_test_init().  Fix this by returning an error when user_data is less than ETH_HLEN in bpf_test_init(). Additionally remove the check for if (user_size > size) as it is unnecessary.

CVE-2024-7457,The ws.stash.app.mac.daemon.helper tool contains a vulnerability caused by an incorrect use of macOS’s authorization model. Instead of validating the client's authorization reference the helper invokes AuthorizationCopyRights() using its own privileged context (root) effectively authorizing itself rather than the client.

CVE-2023-22474,Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server.
