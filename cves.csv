CVE-2024-26721,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/dsc: Fix the macro that calculates DSCC_/DSCA_ PPS reg address  Commit bd077259d0a9 (drm/i915/vdsc: Add function to read any PPS register) defines a new macro to calculate the DSC PPS register addresses with PPS number as an input. This macro correctly calculates the addresses till PPS 11 since the addresses increment by 4. So in that case the following macro works correctly to give correct register address:  _MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4)  However after PPS 11 the register address for PPS 12 increments by 12 because of RC Buffer memory allocation in between. Because of this discontinuity in the address space the macro calculates wrong addresses for PPS 12 - 16 resulting into incorrect DSC PPS parameter value read/writes causing DSC corruption.  This fixes it by correcting this macro to add the offset of 12 for PPS >=12.  v3: Add correct paranthesis for pps argument (Jani Nikula)  (cherry picked from commit 6074be620c31dc2ae11af96a1a5ea95580976fb5),5.5,CWE-131
CVE-2025-37893,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: BPF: Fix off-by-one error in build_prologue()  Vincent reported that running BPF progs with tailcalls on LoongArch causes kernel hard lockup. Debugging the issues shows that the JITed image missing a jirl instruction at the end of the epilogue.  There are two passes in JIT compiling the first pass set the flags and the second pass generates JIT code based on those flags. With BPF progs mixing bpf2bpf and tailcalls build_prologue() generates N insns in the first pass and then generates N+1 insns in the second pass. This makes epilogue_offset off by one and we will jump to some unexpected insn and cause lockup. Fix this by inserting a nop insn.,5.5,CWE-193

CVE-2025-0343,Swift ASN.1 can be caused to crash when parsing certain BER/DER constructions. This crash is caused by a confusion in the ASN.1 library itself which assumes that certain objects can only be provided in either constructed or primitive forms and will trigger a preconditionFailure if that constraint isn't met.  Importantly these constraints are actually required to be true in DER but that correctness wasn't enforced on the early node parser side so it was incorrect to rely on it later on in decoding which is what the library did.  These crashes can be triggered when parsing any DER/BER format object. There is no memory-safety issue here: the crash is a graceful one from the Swift runtime. The impact of this is that it can be used as a denial-of-service vector when parsing BER/DER data from unknown sources e.g. when parsing TLS certificates.,7.5,CWE-228

CVE-2024-53131,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepoint  Patch series nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref bugs on block tracepoints.  This series fixes null pointer dereference bugs that occur when using nilfs2 and two block-related tracepoints.   This patch (of 2):  It has been reported that when using block:block_touch_buffer tracepoint touch_buffer() called from __nilfs_get_folio_block() causes a NULL pointer dereference or a general protection fault when KASAN is enabled.  This happens because since the tracepoint was added in touch_buffer() it references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev regardless of whether the buffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the current implementation the block_device structure is set after the function returns to the caller.  Here touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer head as accessed but the common search helper for folio/page used by the caller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it was reimplemented a long time ago eliminating the need to call touch_buffer() here in the first place.  So this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2021-40658,Textpattern 4.8.7 is affected by a HTML injection vulnerability through “Content>Write>Body”.,4.8,CWE-79
CVE-2024-28199,phlex is an open source framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. This was due to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent these attacks. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML tag malicious event attributes could be included in the output executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all 1.x minor versions. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider configuring a content security policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline`.,7.1,CWE-79
CVE-2023-0916,A vulnerability classified as critical was found in SourceCodester Auto Dealer Management System 1.0. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /adms/classes/Users.php. The manipulation leads to improper access controls. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-221491.,6.3,CWE-284
CVE-2023-47175,Cross-site scripting vulnerability in LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4M (MySQL version) and LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.2.4L (SQLite version) allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary script on the web browser of the user who is accessing the product.,6.1,CWE-79
CVE-2024-3167,The Ocean Extra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘twitter_username’ parameter in versions up to and including 2.2.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.,6.4,CWE-79
CVE-2023-38206,Adobe ColdFusion versions 2018u18 (and earlier) 2021u8 (and earlier) and 2023u2 (and earlier) are affected by an Improper Access Control vulnerability that could result in a Security feature bypass. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to access the administration CFM and CFC endpoints resulting in a low-confidentiality impact. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.,5.3,CWE-284
CVE-2023-51613,D-Link DIR-X3260 prog.cgi SetDynamicDNSSettings Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-X3260 routers. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the prog.cgi binary which handles HNAP requests made to the lighttpd webserver listening on TCP ports 80 and 443. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-21590.,8.0,CWE-121
