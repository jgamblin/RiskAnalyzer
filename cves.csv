CVE-2020-7942,Previously Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised certificate allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a node's catalog falls back to the `default` node the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet 6.13.0 and 5.5.19 changes the default behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It is recommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are not upgrading still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure behavior. Affected software versions: Puppet 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet Agent 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet 5.5.x prior to 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.x prior to 5.5.19 Resolved in: Puppet 6.13.0 Puppet Agent 6.13.0 Puppet 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.19,6.5,CWE-295

CVE-2024-52308,The GitHub CLI version 2.6.1 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution through a malicious codespace SSH server when using `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands. This has been patched in the cli v2.62.0.  Developers connect to remote codespaces through an SSH server running within the devcontainer which is generally provided through the [default devcontainer image]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-... https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration) . GitHub CLI [retrieves SSH connection details]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/inv... https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/invoker.go#L230-L244 ) such as remote username which is used in [executing `ssh` commands]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L2... https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L263 ) for `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands.  This exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute arbitrary code on the user's workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand=echo hacked #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.  In `2.62.0` the remote username information is being validated before being used.,8.0,CWE-77

CVE-2024-46845,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing/timerlat: Only clear timer if a kthread exists  The timerlat tracer can use user space threads to check for osnoise and timer latency. If the program using this is killed via a SIGTERM the threads are shutdown one at a time and another tracing instance can start up resetting the threads before they are fully closed. That causes the hrtimer assigned to the kthread to be shutdown and freed twice when the dying thread finally closes the file descriptors causing a use-after-free bug.  Only cancel the hrtimer if the associated thread is still around. Also add the interface_lock around the resetting of the tlat_var->kthread.  Note this is just a quick fix that can be backported to stable. A real fix is to have a better synchronization between the shutdown of old threads and the starting of new ones.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-49085,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drbd: Fix five use after free bugs in get_initial_state  In get_initial_state it calls notify_initial_state_done(skb..) if cb->args[5]==1. If genlmsg_put() failed in notify_initial_state_done() the skb will be freed by nlmsg_free(skb). Then get_initial_state will goto out and the freed skb will be used by return value skb->len which is a uaf bug.  What's worse the same problem goes even further: skb can also be freed in the notify_*_state_change -> notify_*_state calls below. Thus 4 additional uaf bugs happened.  My patch lets the problem callee functions: notify_initial_state_done and notify_*_state_change return an error code if errors happen. So that the error codes could be propagated and the uaf bugs can be avoid.  v2 reports a compilation warning.
