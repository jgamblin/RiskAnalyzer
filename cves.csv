CVE-2024-49864,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation  In rxrpc_open_socket() it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O thread that will handle it.  This is a problem however as there's a gap between the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv() from the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O thread.  As a quick fix just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's no I/O thread yet.  A better but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such that the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.,4.7,CWE-362

When a specifically malformed DHCP packet is received from a DHCP client the jdhcpd process crashes which will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby resulting in a sustained DoS. The DHCP process will restart automatically to recover the service.

CVE-2025-30644,A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the flexible PIC concentrator (FPC) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX2300 EX3400 EX4100 EX4300 EX4300MP EX4400 EX4600 EX4650-48Y and QFX5k Series allows an attacker to send a specific DHCP packet to the device leading to an FPC crash and restart resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  Under a rare timing scenario outside the attacker's control memory corruption may be observed when DHCP Option 82 is enabled leading to an FPC crash and affecting packet forwarding. Due to the nature of the heap-based overflow exploitation of this vulnerability could also lead to remote code execution within the FPC resulting in complete control of the vulnerable component.

CVE-2024-45022,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/vmalloc: fix page mapping if vm_area_alloc_pages() with high order fallback to order 0  The __vmap_pages_range_noflush() assumes its argument pages** contains pages with the same page shift.  However since commit e9c3cda4d86e (mm vmalloc: fix high order __GFP_NOFAIL allocations) if gfp_flags includes __GFP_NOFAIL with high order in vm_area_alloc_pages() and page allocation failed for high order the pages** may contain two different page shifts (high order and order-0).  This could lead __vmap_pages_range_noflush() to perform incorrect mappings potentially resulting in memory corruption.  Users might encounter this as follows (vmap_allow_huge = true 2M is for PMD_SIZE):  kvmalloc(2M __GFP_NOFAIL|GFP_X)     __vmalloc_node_range_noprof(vm_flags=VM_ALLOW_HUGE_VMAP)         vm_area_alloc_pages(order=9) ---> order-9 allocation failed and fallback to order-0             vmap_pages_range()                 vmap_pages_range_noflush()                     __vmap_pages_range_noflush(page_shift = 21) ----> wrong mapping happens  We can remove the fallback code because if a high-order allocation fails __vmalloc_node_range_noprof() will retry with order-0.  Therefore it is unnecessary to fallback to order-0 here.  Therefore fix this by removing the fallback code.,5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2024-41038,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp: Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headers  Check that all fields of a V2 algorithm header fit into the available firmware data buffer.  The wmfw V2 format introduced variable-length strings in the algorithm block header. This means the overall header length is variable and the position of most fields varies depending on the length of the string fields. Each field must be checked to ensure that it does not overflow the firmware data buffer.  As this ia bugfix patch the fixes avoid making any significant change to the existing code. This makes it easier to review and less likely to introduce new bugs.,5.5,CWE-120

CVE-2021-46390,An access control issue in the authentication module of Lexar_F35 v1.0.34 allows attackers to access sensitive data and cause a Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker without access to securely protected data on a secure USB flash drive can bypass user authentication without having any information related to the password of the registered user. The secure USB flash drive transmits the password entered by the user to the authentication module in the drive after the user registers a password and then the input password is compared with the registered password stored in the authentication module. Subsequently the module returns the comparison result for the authentication decision. Therefore an attacker can bypass password authentication by analyzing the functions that return the password verification or comparison results and manipulate the authentication result values. Accordingly even if attackers enter an incorrect password they can be authenticated as a legitimate user and can therefore exploit functions of the secure USB flash drive by manipulating the authentication result values.,6.8,CWE-287

CVE-2025-32032,The Apollo Router Core is a configurable high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan specifically due to internal optimizations being frequently bypassed. The query planner includes an optimization that significantly speeds up planning for applicable GraphQL selections. However queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments can generate many selections where this optimization does not apply leading to significantly longer planning times. Because the query planner does not enforce a timeout a small number of such queries can exhaust router's thread pool rendering it inoperable. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2023-29201,XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The restricted mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1 only escaped `<script>` and `<style>`-tags but neither attributes that can be used to inject scripts nor other dangerous HTML tags like `<iframe>`. As a consequence any code relying on this restricted mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (cross-site scripting/XSS). When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights impacting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6 RC1 with the introduction of a filter with allowed HTML elements and attributes that is enabled in restricted mode. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.,9.0,CWE-79
