CVE-2024-23185,Very large headers can cause resource exhaustion when parsing message. The message-parser normally reads reasonably sized chunks of the message. However when it feeds them to message-header-parser it starts building up full_value buffer out of the smaller chunks. The full_value buffer has no size limit so large headers can cause large memory usage. It doesn't matter whether it's a single long header line or a single header split into multiple lines. This bug exists in all Dovecot versions. Incoming mails typically have some size limits set by MTA so even largest possible header size may still fit into Dovecot's vsz_limit. So attackers probably can't DoS a victim user this way. A user could APPEND larger mails though allowing them to DoS themselves (although maybe cause some memory issues for the backend in general). One can implement restrictions on headers on MTA component preceding Dovecot. No publicly available exploits are known.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2023-29019,@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected versions for user authentication in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism are vulnerable to session fixation attacks from network and same-site attackers. fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a solution newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. ,8.1,CWE-384

CVE-2021-46937,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/dbgfs: fix 'struct pid' leaks in 'dbgfs_target_ids_write()'  DAMON debugfs interface increases the reference counts of 'struct pid's for targets from the 'target_ids' file write callback ('dbgfs_target_ids_write()') but decreases the counts only in DAMON monitoring termination callback ('dbgfs_before_terminate()').  Therefore when 'target_ids' file is repeatedly written without DAMON monitoring start/termination the reference count is not decreased and therefore memory for the 'struct pid' cannot be freed.  This commit fixes this issue by decreasing the reference counts when 'target_ids' is written.,5.5,CWE-668

CVE-2023-48220,Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version 0.4.rc3 and prior to version 2.0.9 of the `devise_invitable` gem the invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited amount of time through the password reset functionality. This issue creates vulnerable dependencies starting in version 0.0.1.alpha3 and prior to versions 0.26.9 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 of the `decidim` `decidim-admin` and `decidim-system` gems. When using the password reset functionality the `devise_invitable` gem always accepts the pending invitation if the user has been invited. The only check done is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for` expiry period. Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this configuration should be respected. The bug is in the `devise_invitable` gem and should be fixed there and the dependency should be upgraded in Decidim once the fix becomes available. `devise_invitable` to version `2.0.9` and above fix this issue. Versions 0.26.9 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 of the `decidim` `decidim-admin` and `decidim-system` gems contain this fix. As a workaround invitations can be cancelled directly from the database.,5.7,CWE-672

CVE-2024-47872,Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** on any Gradio server that allows file uploads. Authenticated users can upload files such as HTML JavaScript or SVG files containing malicious scripts. When other users download or view these files the scripts will execute in their browser allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions or steal sensitive information from their sessions. This impacts any Gradio server that allows file uploads particularly those using components that process or display user-uploaded files. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. As a workaround users can restrict the types of files that can be uploaded to the Gradio server by limiting uploads to non-executable file types such as images or text. Additionally developers can implement server-side validation to sanitize uploaded files ensuring that HTML JavaScript and SVG files are properly handled or rejected before being stored or displayed to users.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2024-44947,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fuse: Initialize beyond-EOF page contents before setting uptodate  fuse_notify_store() unlike fuse_do_readpage() does not enable page zeroing (because it can be used to change partial page contents).  So fuse_notify_store() must be more careful to fully initialize page contents (including parts of the page that are beyond end-of-file) before marking the page uptodate.  The current code can leave beyond-EOF page contents uninitialized which makes these uninitialized page contents visible to userspace via mmap().  This is an information leak but only affects systems which do not enable init-on-alloc (via CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y or the corresponding kernel command line parameter).,5.5,CWE-665

CVE-2023-52638,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock  The following 3 locks would race against each other causing the deadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:  - j1939_socks_lock - active_session_list_lock - sk_session_queue_lock  A reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock since in the rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list that j1939_socks_lock is protecting the code does not attempt to acquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency where for example the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock and attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock and at the same time another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding sk_session_queue_lock.  NOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug reported by Syzbot; instead it solves a deadlock situation to prepare for one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug which appears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.

CVE-2022-29246,Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host device and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack. Prior to version 6.1.11 he USBX DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function does not assure that a buffer overflow will not occur during handling of the DFU UPLOAD command. When an attacker issues the `UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD` control transfer request with `wLenght` larger than the buffer size (`UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH` 256 bytes) depending on the actual implementation of `dfu -> ux_slave_class_dfu_read` a buffer overflow may occur. In example `ux_slave_class_dfu_read` may read 4096 bytes (or more up to 65k) to a 256 byte buffer ultimately resulting in an overflow. Furthermore in case an attacker has some control over the read flash memory this may result in execution of arbitrary code and platform compromise. A fix for this issue has been included in USBX release 6.1.11. As a workaround align request and buffer size to assure that buffer boundaries are respected.,9.8,CWE-120
