Various software builds for the following TCL devices (30Z and 10L) and Motorola devices (Moto G Pure and Moto G Power) leak the Wi-Fi MAC address to a system property that can be accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher but in these instances they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows: TCL A3X (TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF:11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAAZ:user/release-keys TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF:11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAB3:user/release-keys TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF:11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAB7:user/release-keys TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF:11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABA:user/release-keys TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF:11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABM:user/release-keys TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF:11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABP:user/release-keys and TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF:11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABS:user/release-keys); TCL 10L (TCL/T770B/T1_LITE:10/QKQ1.200329.002/3CJ0:user/release-keys and TCL/T770B/T1_LITE:11/RKQ1.210107.001/8BIC:user/release-keys); Motorola Moto G Pure (motorola/ellis_trac/ellis:11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-2/74844:user/release-keys motorola/ellis_trac/ellis:11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-7/5cde8:user/release-keys motorola/ellis_trac/ellis:11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-10/d67faa:user/release-keys motorola/ellis_trac/ellis:11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-13/b4a29:user/release-keys motorola/ellis_trac/ellis:12/S3RH32.20-42-10/1c2540:user/release-keys motorola/ellis_trac/ellis:12/S3RHS32.20-42-13-2-1/6368dd:user/release-keys motorola/ellis_a/ellis:11/RRH31.Q3-46-50-2/20fec:user/release-keys motorola/ellis_vzw/ellis:11/RRH31.Q3-46-138/103bd:user/release-keys motorola/ellis_vzw/ellis:11/RRHS31.Q3-46-138-2/e5502:user/release-keys and motorola/ellis_vzw/ellis:12/S3RHS32.20-42-10-14-2/5e0b0:user/release-keys); and Motorola Moto G Power (motorola/tonga_g/tonga:11/RRQ31.Q3-68-16-2/e5877:user/release-keys and motorola/tonga_g/tonga:12/S3RQS32.20-42-10-6/f876d3:user/release-keys).

CVE-2022-44749,A directory traversal vulnerability in the ZIP archive extraction routines of KNIME Analytics Platform 3.2.0 and above can result in arbitrary files being overwritten on the user's system. This vulnerability is also known as 'Zip-Slip'.      An attacker can create a KNIME workflow that when being opened by a user can overwrite arbitrary files that the user has write access to. It's not necessary to execute the workflow opening the workflow is sufficient. The user will notice that something is wrong because an error is being reported but only after the files have already been written.  This can impact data integrity (file contents are changed) or cause errors in other software (vital files being corrupted). It can even lead to remote code execution if executable files are being replaced and subsequently executed by the user. In all cases the attacker has to know the location of files on the user's system though.   ,5.5,CWE-22

CVE-2024-4284,A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a denial of service (DoS) condition through the modification of a user's `id` attribute to a value of 0. This issue affects the current version of the software with the latest commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker with manager or admin privileges can render a chosen account completely inaccessible. The application's mechanism for suspending accounts does not provide a means to reverse this condition through the UI leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. The vulnerability is introduced due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the user modification endpoint and the middleware's token validation logic. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0 of the software.,4.9,CWE-400

CVE-2025-32032,The Apollo Router Core is a configurable high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan specifically due to internal optimizations being frequently bypassed. The query planner includes an optimization that significantly speeds up planning for applicable GraphQL selections. However queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments can generate many selections where this optimization does not apply leading to significantly longer planning times. Because the query planner does not enforce a timeout a small number of such queries can exhaust router's thread pool rendering it inoperable. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2024-41663,Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network.  A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the Cloned Website Canarytoken whereby the Canarytoken's creator can attack themselves. The creator of a slow-redirect Canarytoken can insert Javascript into the destination URL of their slow redirect token. When the creator later browses the management page for their own Canarytoken the Javascript executes. This is a self-XSS. An attacker could create a Canarytoken with this self-XSS and send the management link to a victim. When they click on it the Javascript would execute. However no sensitive information (ex. session information) will be disclosed to the malicious actor. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image or any Docker image after `sha-097d91a`.,3.5,CWE-79
CVE-2022-22593,A buffer overflow issue was addressed with improved memory handling. This issue is fixed in iOS 15.3 and iPadOS 15.3 watchOS 8.4 tvOS 15.3 Security Update 2022-001 Catalina macOS Monterey 12.2 macOS Big Sur 11.6.3.

CVE-2023-0466,The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.  As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function.  Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.  Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.,5.3,CWE-295
