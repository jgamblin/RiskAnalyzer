CVE-2024-49924,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: pxafb: Fix possible use after free in pxafb_task()  In the pxafb_probe function it calls the pxafb_init_fbinfo function after which &fbi->task is associated with pxafb_task. Moreover within this pxafb_init_fbinfo function the pxafb_blank function within the &pxafb_ops struct is capable of scheduling work.  If we remove the module which will call pxafb_remove to make cleanup it will call unregister_framebuffer function which can call do_unregister_framebuffer to free fbi->fb through put_fb_info(fb_info) while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                                CPU1                                     | pxafb_task pxafb_remove                       | unregister_framebuffer(info)       | do_unregister_framebuffer(fb_info) | put_fb_info(fb_info)               | // free fbi->fb                    | set_ctrlr_state(fbi state)                                    | __pxafb_lcd_power(fbi 0)                                    | fbi->lcd_power(on &fbi->fb.var)                                    | //use fbi->fb  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in pxafb_remove.

CVE-2024-50335,SuiteCRM is an open-source enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. The Publish Key field in SuiteCRM's Edit Profile page is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This can be exploited to steal CSRF tokens and perform unauthorized actions such as creating new administrative users without proper authentication. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the Publish Key field within the SuiteCRM application. When an attacker injects a malicious script it gets executed within the context of an authenticated user's session. The injected script (o.js) then leverages the captured CSRF token to forge requests that create new administrative users effectively compromising the integrity and security of the CRM instance. This issue has been addressed in versions 7.14.6 and 8.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.9,CWE-79

CVE-2022-23583,Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that any binary op would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the op. In that case calling the templated binary operator for the binary op would receive corrupted data due to the type confusion involved. If `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly. In most cases this would be a silent failure but we have noticed scenarios where this results in a `CHECK` crash hence a denial of service. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1 TensorFlow 2.6.3 and TensorFlow 2.5.3 as these are also affected and still in supported range.,6.5,CWE-617

CVE-2023-52501,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Do not attempt to read past commit  When iterating over the ring buffer while the ring buffer is active the writer can corrupt the reader. There's barriers to help detect this and handle it but that code missed the case where the last event was at the very end of the page and has only 4 bytes left.  The checks to detect the corruption by the writer to reads needs to see the length of the event. If the length in the first 4 bytes is zero then the length is stored in the second 4 bytes. But if the writer is in the process of updating that code there's a small window where the length in the first 4 bytes could be zero even though the length is only 4 bytes. That will cause rb_event_length() to read the next 4 bytes which could happen to be off the allocated page.  To protect against this fail immediately if the next event pointer is less than 8 bytes from the end of the commit (last byte of data) as all events must be a minimum of 8 bytes anyway.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2024-45013,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()  Commit 4733b65d82bd (nvme: start keep-alive after admin queue setup) moves starting keep-alive from nvme_start_ctrl() into nvme_init_ctrl_finish() but don't move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl() so keep-alive work can be started and keep pending after failing to start controller finally use-after-free is triggered if nvme host driver is unloaded.  This patch fixes kernel panic when running nvme/004 in case that connection failure is triggered by moving stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl().  This way is reasonable because keep-alive is now started in nvme_init_ctrl_finish().,5.5,CWE-416

In affected versions when using our Curl handler it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin (change in host scheme or port) if we choose to follow it we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before continuing stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2 where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend rather than curl.,7.7,CWE-200
