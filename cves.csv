CVE-2022-29219,Lodestar is a TypeScript implementation of the Ethereum Consensus specification. Prior to version 0.36.0 there is a possible consensus split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain. Because the developers represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s there is an issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain. In those cases Lodestar may view valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as invalid due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus split where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network. Similarly Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as valid thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases so one may carefully use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus.,7.5,CWE-190

CVE-2024-56695,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'  The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable which could lead to stack overflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc` thereby reducing the stack size.  This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space  in scenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is freed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory leaks.  Fixes the below with gcc W=1: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function ‘kfd_get_cu_occupancy’: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]   322 | }       | ^,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2024-39912,web-auth/webauthn-lib is an open source set of PHP libraries and a Symfony bundle to allow developers to integrate that authentication mechanism into their web applications. The ProfileBasedRequestOptionsBuilder method returns allowedCredentials without any credentials if no username was found. When WebAuthn is used as the first or only authentication method an attacker can enumerate usernames based on the absence of the `allowedCredentials` property in the assertion options response. This allows enumeration of valid or invalid usernames. By knowing which usernames are valid attackers can focus their efforts on a smaller set of potential targets increasing the efficiency and likelihood of successful attacks. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.3,CWE-204
CVE-2021-34872,This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Bentley View 10.15.0.75.

CVE-2025-12512,The GenerateBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information exposure due to missing object-level authorization checks in versions up to and including 2.1.2. This is due to the plugin registering multiple REST API routes under `generateblocks/v1/meta/` that gate access with `current_user_can('edit_posts')` which is granted to low-privileged roles such as Contributor. The handlers accept arbitrary entity IDs (user IDs post IDs etc.) and meta keys returning any requested metadata with only a short blacklist of password-like keys for protection. There is no object-level authorization ensuring the caller is requesting only their own data and there is no allowlist of safe keys. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above to exfiltrate personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive profile data of administrator accounts or any other users by directly querying user meta keys via the exposed endpoints via the `get_user_meta_rest` function. In typical WordPress + WooCommerce setups this includes names email phone and address fields that WooCommerce stores in user meta enabling targeted phishing account takeover pretexting and privacy breaches.,4.3,CWE-200

CVE-2025-5350,SSRF and Reflected XSS Vulnerabilities exist in multiple WSO2 products within the deprecated Try-It feature which was accessible only to administrative users. This feature accepted user-supplied URLs without proper validation leading to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Additionally the retrieved content was directly reflected in the HTTP response enabling reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the admin user's browser context.  By tricking an administrator into accessing a crafted link an attacker could force the server to fetch malicious content and reflect it into the admin’s browser leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution for UI manipulation or data exfiltration. While session cookies are protected with the HttpOnly flag the XSS still poses a significant security risk.

CVE-2025-64496,Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Versions 0.6.224 and prior contain a code injection vulnerability in the Direct Connections feature that allows malicious external model servers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in victim browsers via Server-Sent Event (SSE) execute events. This leads to authentication token theft complete account takeover and when chained with the Functions API enables remote code execution on the backend server. The attack requires the victim to enable Direct Connections (disabled by default) and add the attacker's malicious model URL achievable through social engineering of the admin and subsequent users. This issue is fixed in version 0.6.35.,7.3,CWE-95
