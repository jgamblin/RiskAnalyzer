CVE-2022-41952,Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will attempt to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting connection time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server (for instance Icecast). This can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is for example posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not supported and always fails 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0 to fully resolve the issue. As a workaround turn off URL preview functionality by setting `url_preview_enabled: false` in the Synapse configuration file.,6.5,CWE-400

CVE-2023-35946,Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency cache it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates Gradle can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside the dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle process has write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will refuse to cache dependencies that have path traversal elements in their dependency coordinates. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2 `dependency verification` will make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit.,6.9,CWE-22

CVE-2022-49219,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/pci: fix memory leak during D3hot to D0 transition  If 'vfio_pci_core_device::needs_pm_restore' is set (PCI device does not have No_Soft_Reset bit set in its PMCSR config register) then the current PCI state will be saved locally in 'vfio_pci_core_device::pm_save' during D0->D3hot transition and same will be restored back during D3hot->D0 transition. For saving the PCI state locally pci_store_saved_state() is being used and the pci_load_and_free_saved_state() will free the allocated memory.  But for reset related IOCTLs vfio driver calls PCI reset-related API's which will internally change the PCI power state back to D0. So when the guest resumes then it will get the current state as D0 and it will skip the call to vfio_pci_set_power_state() for changing the power state to D0 explicitly. In this case the memory pointed by 'pm_save' will never be freed. In a malicious sequence the state changing to D3hot followed by VFIO_DEVICE_RESET/VFIO_DEVICE_PCI_HOT_RESET can be run in a loop and it can cause an OOM situation.  This patch frees the earlier allocated memory first before overwriting 'pm_save' to prevent the mentioned memory leak.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2022-49200,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: btmtksdio: Fix kernel oops in btmtksdio_interrupt  Fix the following kernel oops in btmtksdio_interrrupt  [   14.339134]  btmtksdio_interrupt+0x28/0x54 [   14.339139]  process_sdio_pending_irqs+0x68/0x1a0 [   14.339144]  sdio_irq_work+0x40/0x70 [   14.339154]  process_one_work+0x184/0x39c [   14.339160]  worker_thread+0x228/0x3e8 [   14.339168]  kthread+0x148/0x3ac [   14.339176]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x30  That happened because hdev->power_on is already called before sdio_set_drvdata which btmtksdio_interrupt handler relies on is not properly set up.  The details are shown as the below: hci_register_dev would run queue_work(hdev->req_workqueue &hdev->power_on) as WQ_HIGHPRI workqueue_struct to complete the power-on sequeunce and thus hci_power_on may run before sdio_set_drvdata is done in btmtksdio_probe.  The hci_dev_do_open in hci_power_on would initialize the device and enable the interrupt and thus it is possible that btmtksdio_interrupt is being called right before sdio_set_drvdata is filled out.  When btmtksdio_interrupt is being called and sdio_set_drvdata is not filled  the kernel oops is going to happen because btmtksdio_interrupt access an uninitialized pointer.,5.5,CWE-908

CVE-2025-30216,CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`).

CVE-2023-41045,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Graylog makes use of only one single source port for DNS queries. Graylog binds a single socket for outgoing DNS queries and while that socket is bound to a random port number it is never changed again. This goes against recommended practice since 2008 when Dan Kaminsky discovered how easy is to carry out DNS cache poisoning attacks. In order to prevent cache poisoning with spoofed DNS responses it is necessary to maximise the uncertainty in the choice of a source port for a DNS query. Although unlikely in many setups an external attacker could inject forged DNS responses into a Graylog's lookup table cache. In order to prevent this it is at least recommendable to distribute the DNS queries through a pool of distinct sockets each of them with a random source port and renew them periodically. This issue has been addressed in versions 5.0.9 and 5.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,3.7,CWE-345
