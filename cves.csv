CVE-2024-41066,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak  Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during transmit:     tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;     free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;     consumer_index ++; Where variable data looks like this:     free_map == [4 IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP 0 3]                                                	consumer_index^     tx_buff == [skb=null skb=<ptr> skb=<ptr> skb=null skb=null]  The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed to an unused/null skb address. So if by some chance our free_map and tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop sending packets eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.  Therefore add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2025-12638,Keras version 3.11.3 is affected by a path traversal vulnerability in the keras.utils.get_file() function when extracting tar archives. The vulnerability arises because the function uses Python's tarfile.extractall() method without the security-critical filter='data' parameter. Although Keras attempts to filter unsafe paths using filter_safe_paths() this filtering occurs before extraction and a PATH_MAX symlink resolution bug triggers during extraction. This bug causes symlink resolution to fail due to path length limits resulting in a security bypass that allows files to be written outside the intended extraction directory. This can lead to arbitrary file writes outside the cache directory enabling potential system compromise or malicious code execution. The vulnerability affects Keras installations that process tar archives with get_file() and does not affect versions where this extraction method is secured with the appropriate filter parameter.,8.0,CWE-22

CVE-2024-26789,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: arm64/neonbs - fix out-of-bounds access on short input  The bit-sliced implementation of AES-CTR operates on blocks of 128 bytes and will fall back to the plain NEON version for tail blocks or inputs that are shorter than 128 bytes to begin with.  It will call straight into the plain NEON asm helper which performs all memory accesses in granules of 16 bytes (the size of a NEON register). For this reason the associated plain NEON glue code will copy inputs shorter than 16 bytes into a temporary buffer given that this is a rare occurrence and it is not worth the effort to work around this in the asm code.  The fallback from the bit-sliced NEON version fails to take this into account potentially resulting in out-of-bounds accesses. So clone the same workaround and use a temp buffer for short in/outputs.,7.1,CWE-125
CVE-2023-49568,A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.11.

CVE-2023-25572,react-admin is a frontend framework for building browser applications on top of REST/GraphQL APIs. react-admin prior to versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 along with ra-ui-materialui prior to 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. All React applications built with react-admin and using the `<RichTextField>` are affected. `<RichTextField>` outputs the field value using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without client-side sanitization. If the data isn't sanitized server-side this opens a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 now use `DOMPurify` to escape the HTML before outputting it with React and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Users who already sanitize HTML data server-side do not need to upgrade. As a workaround users may replace the `<RichTextField>` by a custom field doing sanitization by hand. ,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2022-30320,Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 uses a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. According to FSCT-2022-0063 there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.,4.3,CWE-327
