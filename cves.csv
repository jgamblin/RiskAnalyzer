CVE-2024-35185,Minder is a software supply chain security platform. Prior to version 0.0.49 the Minder REST ingester is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via an attacker-controlled REST endpoint that can crash the Minder server. The REST ingester allows users to interact with REST endpoints to fetch data for rule evaluation. When fetching data with the REST ingester Minder sends a request to an endpoint and will use the data from the body of the response as the data to evaluate against a certain rule. If the response is sufficiently large it can drain memory on the machine and crash the Minder server. The attacker can control the remote REST endpoints that Minder sends requests to and they can configure the remote REST endpoints to return responses with large bodies. They would then instruct Minder to send a request to their configured endpoint that would return the large response which would crash the Minder server. Version 0.0.49 fixes this issue.,5.3,CWE-400
CVE-2023-40176,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it.

CVE-2024-1931,NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1 contain a vulnerability that can cause denial of service by a certain code path that can lead to an infinite loop. Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client's advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition the code that trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered when the 'ede: yes' option is used; non default configuration. From version 1.19.2 on the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.,7.5,CWE-835

CVE-2024-27286,Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. When a user moves a Zulip message they have the option to move all messages in the topic move only subsequent messages as well or move just a single message.  If the user chose to just move one message and was moving it from a public stream to a private stream Zulip would successfully move the message -- but active users who did not have access to the private stream but whose client had already received the message would continue to see the message in the public stream until they reloaded their client.  Additionally Zulip did not remove view permissions on the message from recently-active users allowing the message to show up in the All messages view or in search results but not in Inbox or Recent conversations views. While the bug has been present since moving messages between streams was first introduced in version 3.0 this option became much more common starting in Zulip 8.0 when the default option in the picker for moving the very last message in a conversation was changed.

CVE-2024-43801,Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. The Jellyfin user profile image upload accepts SVG files allowing for a stored XSS attack against an admin user via a specially crafted malicious SVG file. When viewed by an admin outside of the Jellyfin Web UI (e.g. via view image in a browser) this malicious SVG file could interact with the browser's LocalStorage and retrieve an AccessToken which in turn can be used in an API call to elevate the target user to a Jellyfin administrator. The actual attack vector is unlikely to be exploited as it requires specific actions by the administrator to view the SVG image outside of Jellyfin's WebUI i.e. it is not a passive attack. The underlying exploit mechanism is solved by PR #12490 which forces attached images (including the potential malicious SVG) to be treated as attachments and thus downloaded by browsers rather than viewed. This prevents exploitation of the LocalStorage of the browser. This PR has been merged and the relevant code changes are included in release version 10.9.10. All users are advised to upgrade.,4.6,CWE-200

CVE-2025-62506,MinIO is a high-performance object storage system. In all versions prior to RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z a privilege escalation vulnerability allows service accounts and STS (Security Token Service) accounts with restricted session policies to bypass their inline policy restrictions when performing operations on their own account specifically when creating new service accounts for the same user. The vulnerability exists in the IAM policy validation logic where the code incorrectly relied on the DenyOnly argument when validating session policies for restricted accounts. When a session policy is present the system should validate that the action is allowed by the session policy not just that it is not denied. An attacker with valid credentials for a restricted service or STS account can create a new service account for itself without policy restrictions resulting in a new service account with full parent privileges instead of being restricted by the inline policy. This allows the attacker to access buckets and objects beyond their intended restrictions and modify delete or create objects outside their authorized scope. The vulnerability is fixed in version RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z.,8.1,CWE-863

CVE-2025-59528,Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 3.0.5 Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However during this process it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically inside the convertToValidJSONString function user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.6.,10.0,CWE-94

CVE-2024-47823,Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows for dynamic UI components without leaving PHP. In livewire/livewire prior to `2.12.7` and `v3.5.2` the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g. `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension. If the following criteria are met the attacker can carry out an RCE attack: 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files. This issue has been addressed in release versions `2.12.7` and `3.5.2`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,9.8,CWE-20
