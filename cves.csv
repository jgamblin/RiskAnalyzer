CVE-2023-29515,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user who can create a space can become admin of that space through App Within Minutes. The admin right implies the script right and thus allows JavaScript injection. The vulnerability can be exploited by creating an app in App Within Minutes. If the button should be disabled because the user doesn't have global edit right the app can also be created by directly opening `/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/CreateApplication?wizard=true` on the XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11 14.4.8 14.10.1 and 15.0 RC1 by not granting the space admin right if the user doesn't have script right on the space where the app is created. Error message are displayed to warn the user that the app will be broken in this case. Users who became space admin through this vulnerability won't loose the space admin right due to the fix so it is advised to check if all users who created AWM apps should keep their space admin rights. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.7,CWE-79

CVE-2025-59053,AIRI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence based Grok Companion. In v0.7.2-beta.2 in the `packages/stage-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.vue` path the Markdown content is processed using the useMarkdown composable and the processed HTML is rendered directly into the DOM using v-html. An attacker creates a card file containing malicious HTML/JavaScript then simply processes it using the highlightTagToHtml function (which simply replaces template tags without HTML escaping) and then directly renders it using v-html leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). The project also exposes the Tauri API which can be called from the frontend. The MCP plugin exposes a command execution interface function in `crates/tauri-plugin-mcp/src/lib.rs`. This allows arbitrary command execution. `connect_server` directly passes the user-supplied `command` and `args` parameters to `Command::new(command).args(args)` without any input validation or whitelisting. Thus the previous XSS exploit could achieve command execution through this interface. v0.7.2-beta.3 fixes the issue.,9.6,CWE-94

CVE-2024-41664,Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network. Prior to `sha-8ea5315` Canarytokens.org was vulnerable to a blind SSRF in the Webhook alert feature. When a Canarytoken is created users choose to receive alerts either via email or via a webhook.

CVE-2021-47199,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: CT Fix multiple allocations and memleak of mod acts  CT clear action offload adds additional mod hdr actions to the flow's original mod actions in order to clear the registers which hold ct_state. When such flow also includes encap action a neigh update event can cause the driver to unoffload the flow and then reoffload it.  Each time this happens the ct clear handling adds that same set of mod hdr actions to reset ct_state until the max of mod hdr actions is reached.  Also the driver never releases the allocated mod hdr actions and causing a memleak.

CVE-2025-47938,TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.51 ELTS 10.4.50 ELTS 11.5.44 ELTS 12.4.31 LTS and 13.4.12 LTS the backend user management interface allows password changes without requiring the current password. When an administrator updates their own account or modifies other user accounts via the admin interface the current password is not requested for verification. This behavior may lower the protection against unauthorized access in scenarios where an admin session is hijacked or left unattended as it enables password changes without additional authentication. Users should update to TYPO3 version 9.5.51 ELTS 10.4.50 ELTS 11.5.44 ELTS 12.4.31 LTS or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem.,3.8,CWE-620

CVE-2023-50262,Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter for PHP. When parsing SVG images Dompdf performs an initial validation to ensure that paths within the SVG are allowed. One of the validations is that the SVG document does not reference itself. However prior to version 2.0.4 a recursive chained using two or more SVG documents is not correctly validated. Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server itself.  php-svg-lib when run in isolation does not support SVG references for `image` elements. However when used in combination with Dompdf php-svg-lib will process SVG images referenced by an `image` element. Dompdf currently includes validation to prevent self-referential `image` references but a chained reference is not checked. A malicious actor may thus trigger infinite recursion by chaining references between two or more SVG images.  When Dompdf parses a malicious payload it will crash due after exceeding the allowed execution time or memory usage. An attacker sending multiple request to a system can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle incoming request.  Version 2.0.4 contains a fix for this issue.,5.3,CWE-20

CVE-2024-50058,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too  Commit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access part 3) added few uport == NULL checks. It added one to uart_shutdown() so the commit assumes uport can be NULL in there. But right after that protection there is an unprotected uart_port_dtr_rts(uport false); call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set so I assume that is the reason why we do not see lots of these reports.  Or it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.  Until the above is investigated stay on the safe side and move this dereference to the if too.  I got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130. Thanks.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-36059,matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. In versions prior to 19.4.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This issue has been fixed in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by redacting applicable events waiting for the sync processor to store data and restarting the client. Alternatively redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will often fix most perceived issues. In some cases no workarounds are possible.,8.2,CWE-1321

CVE-2022-20933,A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z3 Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of client-supplied parameters while establishing an SSL VPN session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request and sending it to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to crash and restart resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN connections and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and re-authenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established. Note: When the attack traffic stops the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention. Cisco Meraki has released software updates that address this vulnerability.,8.6,CWE-234

CVE-2023-47636,The Pimcore Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain vulnerabilities such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection) query to view the page source require the attacker to have the full path to the file they wish to view. In the case of pimcore the fopen() function here doesn't have an error handle when the file doesn't exist on the server so the server response raises the full path fopen(/var/www/html/var/tmp/export-{ uniqe id}.csv). This issue has been patched in commit `10d178ef771` which has been included in release version 1.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. ,5.3,CWE-209
