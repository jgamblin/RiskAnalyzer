CVE-2023-27479,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with view rights can execute arbitrary Groovy Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of UIX parameters. A proof of concept exploit is to log in add an `XWiki.UIExtensionClass` xobject to the user profile page with an Extension Parameters content containing `label={{/html}} {{async async=true cached=false context=doc.reference}}{{groovy}}println(Hello  + from groovy!){{/groovy}}{{/async}}`.

CVE-2024-26995,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: tcpm: Correct the PDO counting in pd_set  Off-by-one errors happen because nr_snk_pdo and nr_src_pdo are incorrectly added one. The index of the loop is equal to the number of PDOs to be updated when leaving the loop and it doesn't need to be added one.  When doing the power negotiation TCPM relies on the nr_snk_pdo as the size of the local sink PDO array to match the Source capabilities of the partner port. If the off-by-one overflow occurs a wrong RDO might be sent and unexpected power transfer might happen such as over voltage or over current (than expected).  nr_src_pdo is used to set the Rp level when the port is in Source role. It is also the array size of the local Source capabilities when filling up the buffer which will be sent as the Source PDOs (such as in Power Negotiation). If the off-by-one overflow occurs a wrong Rp level might be set and wrong Source PDOs will be sent to the partner port. This could potentially cause over current or port resets.,7.8,CWE-193

CVE-2024-49985,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: stm32f7: Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume  In case there is any sort of clock controller attached to this I2C bus controller for example Versaclock or even an AIC32x4 I2C codec then an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare callback may trigger a deadlock on drivers/clk/clk.c prepare_lock mutex.  This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex and then performs the prepare operation including its I2C access. The I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback which calls clk_prepare_enable() which attempts to grab the prepare_lock mutex again and deadlocks.  Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in remove() use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume to avoid hitting the prepare_lock mutex.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-39490,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: sr: fix missing sk_buff release in seg6_input_core  The seg6_input() function is responsible for adding the SRH into a packet delegating the operation to the seg6_input_core(). This function uses the skb_cow_head() to ensure that there is sufficient headroom in the sk_buff for accommodating the link-layer header. In the event that the skb_cow_header() function fails the seg6_input_core() catches the error but it does not release the sk_buff which will result in a memory leak.  This issue was introduced in commit af3b5158b89d (ipv6: sr: fix BUG due to headroom too small after SRH push) and persists even after commit 7a3f5b0de364 (netfilter: add netfilter hooks to SRv6 data plane) where the entire seg6_input() code was refactored to deal with netfilter hooks.  The proposed patch addresses the identified memory leak by requiring the seg6_input_core() function to release the sk_buff in the event that skb_cow_head() fails.,6.2,CWE-401
