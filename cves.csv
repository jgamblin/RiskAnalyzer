CVE-2025-24787,WhoDB is an open source database management tool. In affected versions the application is vulnerable to parameter injection in database connection strings which allows an attacker to read local files on the machine the application is running on. The application uses string concatenation to build database connection URIs which are then passed to corresponding libraries responsible for setting up the database connections. This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user in many cases to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true` the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one) the attacker is able to read local files. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.6,CWE-943

CVE-2024-50041,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: Fix macvlan leak by synchronizing access to mac_filter_hash  This patch addresses a macvlan leak issue in the i40e driver caused by concurrent access to vsi->mac_filter_hash. The leak occurs when multiple threads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously leading to inconsistent state and potential memory leaks.  To fix this we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing vf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.  Additionally we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) in i40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them. 2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g. adding and deleting 	portvlan and/or mac filters). 3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the 	mac_filter_hash.  This synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents the described leak.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-26723,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag  There is a crash when adding one of the lan966x interfaces under a lag interface. The issue can be reproduced like this: ip link add name bond0 type bond miimon 100 mode balance-xor ip link set dev eth0 master bond0  The reason is because when adding a interface under the lag it would go through all the ports and try to figure out which other ports are under that lag interface. And the issue is that lan966x can have ports that are NULL pointer as they are not probed. So then iterating over these ports it would just crash as they are NULL pointers. The fix consists in actually checking for NULL pointers before accessing something from the ports. Like we do in other places.,7.8,CWE-400

CVE-2022-21698,client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1 HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality and potential memory exhaustion when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods.
