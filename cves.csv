CVE-2025-27789,Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers` and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.

CVE-2024-42082,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xdp: Remove WARN() from __xdp_reg_mem_model()  syzkaller reports a warning in __xdp_reg_mem_model().  The warning occurs only if __mem_id_init_hash_table() returns an error. It returns the error in two cases:    1. memory allocation fails;   2. rhashtable_init() fails when some fields of rhashtable_params      struct are not initialized properly.  The second case cannot happen since there is a static const rhashtable_params struct with valid fields. So warning is only triggered when there is a problem with memory allocation.  Thus there is no sense in using WARN() to handle this error and it can be safely removed.

CVE-2024-56677,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/fadump: Move fadump_cma_init to setup_arch() after initmem_init()  During early init CMA_MIN_ALIGNMENT_BYTES can be PAGE_SIZE since pageblock_order is still zero and it gets initialized later during initmem_init() e.g. setup_arch() -> initmem_init() -> sparse_init() -> set_pageblock_order()  One such use case where this causes issue is - early_setup() -> early_init_devtree() -> fadump_reserve_mem() -> fadump_cma_init()  This causes CMA memory alignment check to be bypassed in cma_init_reserved_mem(). Then later cma_activate_area() can hit a VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(pfn & ((1 << order) - 1)) if the reserved memory area was not pageblock_order aligned.  Fix it by moving the fadump_cma_init() after initmem_init() where other such cma reservations also gets called.  <stack trace> ============== page: refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x0 pfn:0x10010 flags: 0x13ffff800000000(node=1|zone=0|lastcpupid=0x7ffff) CMA raw: 013ffff800000000 5deadbeef0000100 5deadbeef0000122 0000000000000000 raw: 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000 page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(pfn & ((1 << order) - 1)) ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at mm/page_alloc.c:778!

CVE-2025-31477,The Tauri shell plugin allows access to the system shell. Prior to 2.2.1 the Tauri shell plugin exposes functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The open endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. xdg-open on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like https or mailto by default. This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file:// smb:// or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.1.,9.8,CWE-20

CVE-2023-41327,WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules where the allowed list is evaluated first.   Until WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15 the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock’s instance. For example If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token discovered using another exploit via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations.,4.6,CWE-918

CVE-2025-64746,Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.13.0 Directus does not properly clean up field-level permissions when a field is deleted.

This stale reference creates a security gap: if another field is later created using the same name it inherits the outdated permission entry. This behavior can unintentionally grant roles access to data they should not be able to read or modify. The issue is particularly risky in multi-tenant or production environments where administrators may reuse field names assuming old permissions have been fully cleared.

CVE-2024-56740,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs/localio: must clear res.replen in nfs_local_read_done  Otherwise memory corruption can occur due to NFSv3 LOCALIO reads leaving garbage in res.replen: - nfs3_read_done() copies that into server->read_hdrsize; from there   nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests. - nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()   which includes it in hdrsize for xdr_init_pages so that rq_rcv_buf   contains a ridiculous len. - This is copied to rq_private_buf and xs_read_stream_request()   eventually passes the kvec to sock_recvmsg() which receives incoming   data into entirely the wrong place.  This is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads when it is made to pivot back to using normal RPC.  This switch back to using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this issue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3 server while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO.,7.8,CWE-787
