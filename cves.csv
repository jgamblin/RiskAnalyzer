CVE-2023-38545,This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake.  When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself the maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.  If the host name is detected to be longer curl switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug the local variable that means let the host resolve the name could get the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake and contrary to the intention copy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved address there.  The target buffer being a heap based buffer and the host name coming from the URL that curl has been told to operate with.,9.8,CWE-787
CVE-2024-20291,A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming for port channel subinterfaces of Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send traffic that should be blocked through an affected device.

CVE-2023-52501,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Do not attempt to read past commit  When iterating over the ring buffer while the ring buffer is active the writer can corrupt the reader. There's barriers to help detect this and handle it but that code missed the case where the last event was at the very end of the page and has only 4 bytes left.  The checks to detect the corruption by the writer to reads needs to see the length of the event. If the length in the first 4 bytes is zero then the length is stored in the second 4 bytes. But if the writer is in the process of updating that code there's a small window where the length in the first 4 bytes could be zero even though the length is only 4 bytes. That will cause rb_event_length() to read the next 4 bytes which could happen to be off the allocated page.  To protect against this fail immediately if the next event pointer is less than 8 bytes from the end of the commit (last byte of data) as all events must be a minimum of 8 bytes anyway.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2023-31135,Dgraph is an open source distributed GraphQL database. Existing Dgraph audit logs are vulnerable to brute force attacks due to nonce collisions.

This case is managed earlier by triggering an asynchronous M3 exit via controller resume/suspend callbacks that in turn will cause M0 transition and DB update.  So since it's not an error but just delaying of doorbell update there is no reason to return an error.  This also fixes a use after free error for skb case indeed a caller queuing skb will try to free the skb if the queueing fails but in that case queueing has been done.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-42282,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mediatek: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dummy net_device handling  Move the freeing of the dummy net_device from mtk_free_dev() to mtk_remove().  Previously if alloc_netdev_dummy() failed in mtk_probe() eth->dummy_dev would be NULL. The error path would then call mtk_free_dev() which in turn called free_netdev() assuming dummy_dev was allocated (but it was not) potentially causing a NULL pointer dereference.  By moving free_netdev() to mtk_remove() we ensure it's only called when mtk_probe() has succeeded and dummy_dev is fully allocated. This addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference detected by Smatch[1].,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-50145,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()  build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.  __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb allocation fails keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case don't process the packets and don't push them up the network stack - they are skipped.  Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.
