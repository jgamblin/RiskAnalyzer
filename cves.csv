CVE-2022-21728,Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `ReverseSequence` does not fully validate the value of `batch_dim` and can result in a heap OOB read. There is a check to make sure the value of `batch_dim` does not go over the rank of the input but there is no check for negative values. Negative dimensions are allowed in some cases to mimic Python's negative indexing (i.e. indexing from the end of the array) however if the value is too negative then the implementation of `Dim` would access elements before the start of an array.

CVE-2024-50197,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: intel: platform: fix error path in device_for_each_child_node()  The device_for_each_child_node() loop requires calls to fwnode_handle_put() upon early returns to decrement the refcount of the child node and avoid leaking memory if that error path is triggered.  There is one early returns within that loop in intel_platform_pinctrl_prepare_community() but fwnode_handle_put() is missing.  Instead of adding the missing call the scoped version of the loop can be used to simplify the code and avoid mistakes in the future if new early returns are added as the child node is only used for parsing and it is never assigned.,5.5,CWE-401
CVE-2024-31457,gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin which separates the front and rear of the full stack. gin-vue-admin pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240407133540-7bc7c3051067 corresponding to version 2.6.1 has a code injection vulnerability in the backend. In the Plugin System -> Plugin Template feature an attacker can perform directory traversal by manipulating the `plugName` parameter. They can create specific folders such as `api` `config` `global` `model` `router` `service` and `main.go` function within the specified traversal directory. Moreover the Go files within these folders can have arbitrary code inserted based on a specific PoC parameter. The main reason for the existence of this vulnerability is the controllability of the PlugName field within the struct. Pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240409100909-b1b7427c6ea6 corresponding to commit b1b7427c6ea6c7a027fa188c6be557f3795e732b contains a patch for the issue.

CVE-2024-27005,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  interconnect: Don't access req_list while it's being manipulated  The icc_lock mutex was split into separate icc_lock and icc_bw_lock mutexes in [1] to avoid lockdep splats. However this didn't adequately protect access to icc_node::req_list.  The icc_set_bw() function will eventually iterate over req_list while only holding icc_bw_lock but req_list can be modified while only holding icc_lock. This causes races between icc_set_bw() of_icc_get() and icc_put().  Example A:    CPU0                               CPU1   ----                               ----   icc_set_bw(path_a)     mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);                                      icc_put(path_b)                                        mutex_lock(&icc_lock);     aggregate_requests()       hlist_for_each_entry(r ...                                        hlist_del(...         <r = invalid pointer>  Example B:    CPU0                               CPU1   ----                               ----   icc_set_bw(path_a)     mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);                                      path_b = of_icc_get()                                        of_icc_get_by_index()                                          mutex_lock(&icc_lock);                                          path_find()                                            path_init()     aggregate_requests()       hlist_for_each_entry(r ...                                              hlist_add_head(...         <r = invalid pointer>  Fix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held before manipulating icc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is held don't perform any memory allocations so we should still be safe from the original lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.

CVE-2024-21662,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13 2.9.9 and 2.10.4 an attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account. This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827 intended to protect against brute-force attacks. The application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for that account. This is a severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force attacks at an accelerated rate especially targeting the default admin account. Users should upgrade to version 2.8.13 2.9.9 or 2.10.4 to receive a patch.,7.5,CWE-307

CVE-2021-1440,A vulnerability in the implementation of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) feature of Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) process to crash resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of a specific RPKI to Router (RTR) Protocol packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by compromising the RPKI validator server and sending a specifically crafted RTR packet to an affected device. Alternatively the attacker could use man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate the RPKI validator server and send a specifically crafted RTR response packet over the established RTR TCP connection to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition because the BGP process could constantly restart and BGP routing could become unstable.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This advisory is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

CVE-2025-30095,VyOS 1.3 through 1.5 (fixed in 1.4.2) or any Debian-based system using dropbear in combination with live-build has the same Dropbear private host keys across different installations. Thus an attacker can conduct active man-in-the-middle attacks against SSH connections if Dropbear is enabled as the SSH daemon. I n VyOS this is not the default configuration for the system SSH daemon but is for the console service. To mitigate this one can run rm -f /etc/dropbear/*key* and/or rm -f /etc/dropbear-initramfs/*key* and then dropbearkey -t rsa -s 4096 -f /etc/dropbear_rsa_host_key and reload the service or reboot the system before using Dropbear as the SSH daemon (this clears out all keys mistakenly built into the release image) or update to the latest version of VyOS 1.4 or 1.5. Note that this vulnerability is not unique to VyOS and may appear in any Debian-based Linux distribution that uses Dropbear in combination with live-build which has a safeguard against this behavior in OpenSSH but no equivalent one for Dropbear.,9.0,CWE-321

CVE-2024-43863,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling  Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove the fence from the pending list and thus doesn't require a lock to fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.  vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all fences and update their status to do that it holds a lock to prevent the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending fences for which it holds a lock.  dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll calls the wait which signals the fences which are being destroyed. The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it was called.  Old bug but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling interfaces. Fix those in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock.,5.5,CWE-667

Yet the driver makes such assumption and releases the TD allowing the remaining TRBs to be freed or overwritten by new TDs.  The xHC should also report completion of the final TRB due to its IOC flag being set by us regardless of prior errors.
