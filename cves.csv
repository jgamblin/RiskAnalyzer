CVE-2022-48822,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: f_fs: Fix use-after-free for epfile  Consider a case where ffs_func_eps_disable is called from ffs_func_disable as part of composition switch and at the same time ffs_epfile_release get called from userspace. ffs_epfile_release will free up the read buffer and call ffs_data_closed which in turn destroys ffs->epfiles and mark it as NULL. While this was happening the driver has already initialized the local epfile in ffs_func_eps_disable which is now freed and waiting to acquire the spinlock. Once spinlock is acquired the driver proceeds with the stale value of epfile and tries to free the already freed read buffer causing use-after-free.  Following is the illustration of the race:        CPU1                                  CPU2     ffs_func_eps_disable    epfiles (local copy) 					ffs_epfile_release 					ffs_data_closed 					if (last file closed) 					ffs_data_reset 					ffs_data_clear 					ffs_epfiles_destroy spin_lock dereference epfiles  Fix this races by taking epfiles local copy & assigning it under spinlock and if epfiles(local) is null then update it in ffs->epfiles then finally destroy it. Extending the scope further from the race protecting the ep related structures and concurrent accesses.,7.8,CWE-416

There are multiple ways how guests can cause large memory allocations in xenstored: - - by issuing new requests to xenstored without reading the responses causing the responses to be buffered in memory - - by causing large number of watch events to be generated via setting up multiple xenstore watches and then e.g. deleting many xenstore nodes below the watched path - - by creating as many nodes as allowed with the maximum allowed size and path length in as many transactions as possible - - by accessing many nodes inside a transaction,6.5,CWE-770

CVE-2022-24795,yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data) which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl` which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.,5.9,CWE-122

CVE-2024-31218,Webhood is a self-hosted URL scanner used analyzing phishing and malicious sites. Webhood's backend container images in versions 0.9.0 and earlier are subject to Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a HTTP request to the database (Pocketbase) admin API to create an admin account.

CVE-2022-34890,This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 17.1.1 (51537). An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels Tools component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-16653.,8.8,CWE-822
CVE-2025-29913,CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted telecommand (TC) frame that causes an unsigned integer underflow. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`.,9.8,CWE-125
CVE-2024-5090,The SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's SiteOrigin Blog Widget in all versions up to and including 1.61.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.,6.4,CWE-79
