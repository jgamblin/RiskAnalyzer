CVE-2024-47776,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read has been discovered in gst_wavparse_cue_chunk within gstwavparse.c. The vulnerability happens due to a discrepancy between the size of the data buffer and the size value provided to the function. This mismatch causes the comparison  if (size < 4 + ncues * 24) to fail in some cases allowing the subsequent loop to access beyond the bounds of the data buffer.

CVE-2022-37866,When Apache Ivy downloads artifacts from a repository it stores them in the local file system based on a user-supplied pattern that may include placeholders for artifacts coordinates like the organisation module or version. If said coordinates contain ../ sequences - which are valid characters for Ivy coordinates in general - it is possible the artifacts are stored outside of Ivy's local cache or repository or can overwrite different artifacts inside of the local cache. In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs collaboration by the remote repository as Ivy will issue http requests containing .. sequences and a normal repository will not interpret them as part of the artifact coordinates. Users of Apache Ivy 2.0.0 to 2.5.1 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.,7.5,CWE-22

CVE-2024-26755,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md: Don't suspend the array for interrupted reshape  md_start_sync() will suspend the array if there are spares that can be added or removed from conf however if reshape is still in progress this won't happen at all or data will be corrupted(remove_and_add_spares won't be called from md_choose_sync_action for reshape) hence there is no need to suspend the array if reshape is not done yet.  Meanwhile there is a potential deadlock for raid456:  1) reshape is interrupted;  2) set one of the disk WantReplacement and add a new disk to the array    however recovery won't start until the reshape is finished;  3) then issue an IO across reshpae position this IO will wait for    reshape to make progress;  4) continue to reshape then md_start_sync() found there is a spare disk    that can be added to conf mddev_suspend() is called;  Step 4 and step 3 is waiting for each other deadlock triggered. Noted this problem is found by code review and it's not reporduced yet.  Fix this porblem by don't suspend the array for interrupted reshape this is safe because conf won't be changed until reshape is done.,5.3,CWE-129

CVE-2024-35997,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-up  The flag I2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations. However this is not necessary because I2C core already has its own locking for that.  More importantly this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set in i2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens the interrupt handler (i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doing anything then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in an infinite loop.  Since interrupt handler is an RT task it takes over the CPU and the flag-clearing task never gets scheduled thus we have a lock-up.  Delete this unnecessary flag.,5.5,CWE-667
