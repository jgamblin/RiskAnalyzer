CVE,Description,CVSS3_BaseScore,CWE
CVE-2023-35926,Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires sandbox as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2` but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities  that may not have a fix the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library. A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.,8.0,CWE-94

CVE-2023-29528,XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The restricted mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1 and massively improved in version 14.6-rc-1 allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid HTML comments. As a consequence any code relying on this restricted mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (cross-site scripting/XSS). When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights impacting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10 HTML comments are now removed in restricted mode and a check has been introduced that ensures that comments don't start with `>`. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix. ,9.0,CWE-79

CVE-2024-53055,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix 6 GHz scan construction  If more than 255 colocated APs exist for the set of all APs found during 2.4/5 GHz scanning then the 6 GHz scan construction will loop forever since the loop variable has type u8 which can never reach the number found when that's bigger than 255 and is stored in a u32 variable. Also move it into the loops to have a smaller scope.  Using a u32 there is fine we limit the number of APs in the scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNR entries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scan results a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it's more like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11 we get an upper bound for the number of ~372k well in the bounds of a u32.,5.5,CWE-835

CVE-2023-51442,Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. A security vulnerability has been identified in navidrome's subsonic endpoint allowing for authentication bypass. This exploit enables unauthorized access to any known account by utilizing a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with the key not so secret. The vulnerability can only be exploited on instances that have never been restarted. Navidrome supports an extension to the subsonic authentication scheme where a JWT can be provided using a `jwt` query parameter instead of the traditional password or token and salt (corresponding to resp. the `p` or `t` and `s` query parameters). This authentication bypass vulnerability potentially affects all instances that don't protect the subsonic endpoint `/rest/` which is expected to be most instances in a standard deployment and most instances in the reverse proxy setup too (as the documentation mentions to leave that endpoint unprotected).

CVE-2024-53088,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state  Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN filters by setting mac and port VLAN.  1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan(). 2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac(). 3. Subsequently i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters() which         refers to the already freed filter memory causing corruption.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn multiple VFs. 2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change         MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host. 3. Observe errors in dmesg: Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX 	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX.  Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.  The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list. These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but must be removed using the full process.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2025-27587,OpenSSL 3.0.0 through 3.3.2 on the PowerPC architecture is vulnerable to a Minerva attack exploitable by measuring the time of signing of random messages using the EVP_DigestSign API and then using the private key to extract the K value (nonce) from the signatures. Next based on the bit size of the extracted nonce one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.,5.3,CWE-385
