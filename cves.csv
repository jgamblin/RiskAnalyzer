CVE-2024-25618,Mastodon is a free open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured authentication providers (CAS SAML OIDC) to attach to existing local users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave. However some well-known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover OpenID Connect also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6 4.1.14 4.0.14 and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.2,CWE-287

CVE-2024-26998,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: core: Clearing the circular buffer before NULLifying it  The circular buffer is NULLified in uart_tty_port_shutdown() under the spin lock. However the PM or other timer based callbacks may still trigger after this event without knowning that buffer pointer is not valid. Since the serial code is a bit inconsistent in checking the buffer state (some rely on the head-tail positions some on the buffer pointer) it's better to have both aligned i.e. buffer pointer to be NULL and head-tail possitions to be the same meaning it's empty. This will prevent asynchronous calls to dereference NULL pointer as reported recently in 8250 case:    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference address: 00000cf5   Workqueue: pm pm_runtime_work   EIP: serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)   ...   ? serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)   __start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1551)   serial8250_start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1654)   serial_port_runtime_suspend (include/linux/serial_core.h:667 drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:63)   __rpm_callback (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:393)   ? serial_port_remove (drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:50)   rpm_suspend (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:447)  The proposed change will prevent ->start_tx() to be called during suspend on shut down port.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-39394,Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2 there is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition of the `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This discrepancy causes the function implementation to perform a 4-byte write into a 1-byte buffer provided by the caller. This can lead to three zero bytes being written beyond the 1-byte location provided by the caller. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by providing a 4-byte buffer casted to a 1-byte buffer when calling `wasmtime_trap_code`.

CVE-2023-0401,A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.  The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider.  PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications would be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data.,7.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-25558,DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. When the DataHub frontend is configured to authenticate via SSO it will leverage the pac4j library. The processing of the `id_token` is done in an unsafe manner which is not properly accounted for by the DataHub frontend. Specifically if any of the id_token claims value start with the {#sb64} prefix pac4j considers the value to be a serialized Java object and will deserialize it. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the worst case.

CVE-2023-48220,Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version 0.4.rc3 and prior to version 2.0.9 of the `devise_invitable` gem the invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited amount of time through the password reset functionality. This issue creates vulnerable dependencies starting in version 0.0.1.alpha3 and prior to versions 0.26.9 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 of the `decidim` `decidim-admin` and `decidim-system` gems. When using the password reset functionality the `devise_invitable` gem always accepts the pending invitation if the user has been invited. The only check done is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for` expiry period. Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this configuration should be respected. The bug is in the `devise_invitable` gem and should be fixed there and the dependency should be upgraded in Decidim once the fix becomes available. `devise_invitable` to version `2.0.9` and above fix this issue. Versions 0.26.9 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 of the `decidim` `decidim-admin` and `decidim-system` gems contain this fix. As a workaround invitations can be cancelled directly from the database.,5.7,CWE-672
