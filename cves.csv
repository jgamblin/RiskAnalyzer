CVE-2024-40647,sentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentry's Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Python's `subprocess` calls all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default) this expectation is not fulfilled and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However if it's not possible and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you you can disable all default integrations. ,5.3,CWE-200

The `testDiscord` request handler in `medusa/server/web/home/handler.py` does not validate the user-controlled `discord_webhook` variable and passes it to the `notifiers.discord_notifier.test_notify` method then `_notify_discord` and finally `_send_discord_msg` method  which sends a POST request to the user-controlled URL on line 64 in `/medusa/notifiers/discord.py` which leads to a blind server-side request forgery. This issue allows for crafting POST requests on behalf of the Medusa server. Version 1.0.19 contains a fix for the issue.,5.3,CWE-918

CVE-2024-39480,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kdb: Fix buffer overflow during tab-complete  Currently when the user attempts symbol completion with the Tab key kdb will use strncpy() to insert the completed symbol into the command buffer. Unfortunately it passes the size of the source buffer rather than the destination to strncpy() with predictably horrible results. Most obviously if the command buffer is already full but cp the cursor position is in the middle of the buffer then we will write past the end of the supplied buffer.  Fix this by replacing the dubious strncpy() calls with memmove()/memcpy() calls plus explicit boundary checks to make sure we have enough space before we start moving characters around.,7.8,CWE-120

CVE-2025-30675,In Apache CloudStack a flaw in access control affects the listTemplates and listIsos APIs. A malicious Domain Admin or Resource Admin can exploit this issue by intentionally specifying the 'domainid' parameter along with the 'filter=self' or 'filter=selfexecutable' values. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized visibility into templates and ISOs under the ROOT domain.  A malicious admin can enumerate and extract metadata of templates and ISOs that belong to unrelated domains violating isolation boundaries and potentially exposing sensitive or internal configuration details.   This vulnerability has been fixed by ensuring the domain resolution strictly adheres to the caller's scope rather than defaulting to the ROOT domain.     Affected users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.19.3.0 or 4.20.1.0.,4.7,CWE-200

CVE-2024-6119,Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g. TLS clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.  Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of service.  Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g. TLS clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the application program.  Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures dates ...) is not affected the denial of service can occur only when the application also specifies an expected DNS name Email address or IP address.  TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates and even when they do they generally don't perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected identity) but rather extract the presented identity after checking the certificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity of the issue is Moderate.  The FIPS modules in 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.,7.5,CWE-843

CVE-2024-25618,Mastodon is a free open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured authentication providers (CAS SAML OIDC) to attach to existing local users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave. However some well-known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover OpenID Connect also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6 4.1.14 4.0.14 and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.2,CWE-287
