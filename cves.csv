CVE-2024-49910,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add NULL check for function pointer in dcn401_set_output_transfer_func  This commit adds a null check for the set_output_gamma function pointer in the dcn401_set_output_transfer_func function. Previously set_output_gamma was being checked for null but then it was being dereferenced without any null check. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if set_output_gamma is null.  To fix this we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before dereferencing it. We do this by adding a null check for set_output_gamma before the call to set_output_gamma.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-28436,Tailscale is software for using Wireguard and multi-factor authentication (MFA). A vulnerability identified in the implementation of Tailscale SSH starting in version 1.34.0 and prior to prior to 1.38.2 in FreeBSD allows commands to be run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules. A difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD `setgroups` system call from POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based operating system did not appropriately restrict groups on the host when using Tailscale SSH. When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.  Tailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria: the destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled; Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and a non-interactive SSH session was used.  Affected users should upgrade to version 1.38.2 to remediate the issue.  ,5.7,CWE-269

CVE-2023-24816,IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.,4.5,CWE-20
