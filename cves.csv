CVE-2025-24786,WhoDB is an open source database management tool. While the application only displays Sqlite3 databases present in the directory `/db` there is no path traversal prevention in place. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to open any Sqlite3 database present on the host machine that the application is running on. Affected versions of WhoDB allow users to connect to Sqlite3 databases. By default the databases must be present in `/db/` (or alternatively `./tmp/` if development mode is enabled).  If no databases are present in the default directory the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`. This allows an attacker to use path traversal (`../../`) in order to open any Sqlite3 database present on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,10.0,CWE-22

CVE-2024-49931,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: fix array out-of-bound access in SoC stats  Currently the ath12k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error array is defined with a maximum size of DP_REO_DST_RING_MAX. However the ath12k_dp_rx_process() function access ath12k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error using the REO destination SRNG ring ID which is incorrect.

Upgrading to version 4.5.1 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-223563.,6.3,CWE-89
CVE-2024-41672,DuckDB is a SQL database management system. In versions 1.0.0 and prior content in filesystem is accessible for reading using `sniff_csv` even with `enable_external_access=false`. This vulnerability provides an attacker with access to filesystem even when access is expected to be disabled and other similar functions do NOT provide access. There seem to be two vectors to this vulnerability. First access to files that should otherwise not be allowed. Second the content from a file can be read (e.g. `/etc/hosts` `proc/self/environ` etc) even though that doesn't seem to be the intent of the sniff_csv function. A fix for this issue is available in commit c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a and is expected to be part of version 1.1.0.,7.5,CWE-200
CVE-2024-27347,Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph-Hubble.This issue affects Apache HugeGraph-Hubble: from 1.0.0 before 1.3.0.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.3.0 which fixes the issue.,5.3,CWE-918
CVE-2023-49090,CarrierWave is a solution for file uploads for Rails Sinatra and other Ruby web frameworks. CarrierWave has a Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability possibly leading to XSS. The validation in `allowlisted_content_type?` determines Content-Type permissions by performing a partial match. If the `content_type` argument of `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed a value crafted by the attacker Content-Types not included in the `content_type_allowlist` will be allowed. This issue has been patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.0.5.,6.8,CWE-79
CVE-2023-45819,TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s Notification Manager API. The vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification system which is used in error handling. The conditions for this exploit requires carefully crafted malicious content to have been inserted into the editor and a notification to have been triggered. When a notification was opened the HTML within the text argument was displayed unfiltered in the notification. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an notification presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user.  This issue could also be exploited by any integration which uses a TinyMCE notification to display unfiltered HTML content. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring that the HTML displayed in the notification is sanitized preventing the exploit. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. ,6.1,CWE-79
