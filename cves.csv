CVE-2022-0028,A PAN-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware) VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target. To be misused by an external attacker the firewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a source zone that has an external facing interface. This configuration is not typical for URL filtering and if set is likely unintended by the administrator. If exploited this issue would not impact the confidentiality integrity or availability of our products. However the resulting denial-of-service (DoS) attack may help obfuscate the identity of the attacker and implicate the firewall as the source of the attack. We have taken prompt action to address this issue in our PAN-OS software. All software updates for this issue are expected to be released no later than the week of August 15 2022. This issue does not impact Panorama M-Series or Panorama virtual appliances. This issue has been resolved for all Cloud NGFW and Prisma Access customers and no additional action is required from them.,8.6,CWE-406

The nvdimm_bus_lock() is protecting against unregistration multiple simultaneous ops callers and preventing activate_show() from racing activate_store(). For the first 2 the lock is redundant. Unregistration already flushes all ops users and sysfs already prevents multiple threads to be active in an ops handler at the same time. For the last userspace should already be waiting for its last activate_store() to complete and does not need activate_show() to flush the write side so this lock usage can be deleted in these attributes.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2022-42332,x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where host assisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) is unavailable Xen will run guests in so called shadow mode. Shadow mode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page tables as well as auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests Xen additionally runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-47084,Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability is related to **CORS origin validation** where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attacker’s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially attackers can upload files steal authentication tokens and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround users can manually enforce stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.,8.3,CWE-285

CVE-2024-42282,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mediatek: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dummy net_device handling  Move the freeing of the dummy net_device from mtk_free_dev() to mtk_remove().  Previously if alloc_netdev_dummy() failed in mtk_probe() eth->dummy_dev would be NULL. The error path would then call mtk_free_dev() which in turn called free_netdev() assuming dummy_dev was allocated (but it was not) potentially causing a NULL pointer dereference.  By moving free_netdev() to mtk_remove() we ensure it's only called when mtk_probe() has succeeded and dummy_dev is fully allocated. This addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference detected by Smatch[1].,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2025-21396,Missing authorization in Microsoft Account allows an unauthorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network.,8.2,CWE-862
CVE-2023-41044,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. A partial path traversal vulnerability exists in Graylog's `Support Bundle` feature. The vulnerability is caused by incorrect user input validation in an HTTP API resource. Graylog's Support Bundle feature allows an attacker with valid Admin role credentials to download or delete files in sibling directories of the support bundle directory. The default `data_dir` in operating system packages (DEB RPM) is set to `/var/lib/graylog-server`. The data directory for the Support Bundle feature is always `<data_dir>/support-bundle`. Due to the partial path traversal vulnerability an attacker with valid Admin role credentials can read or delete files in directories that start with a `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundle` directory name. The vulnerability would allow the download or deletion of files in the following example directories: `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundle-test` and `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundlesdirectory`. For the Graylog Docker images the `data_dir` is set to `/usr/share/graylog/data` by default. This vulnerability is fixed in Graylog version 5.1.3 and later. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should block all HTTP requests to the following HTTP API endpoints by using a reverse proxy server in front of Graylog. `GET /api/system/debug/support/bundle/download/{filename}` and `DELETE /api/system/debug/support/bundle/{filename}`. ,3.3,CWE-22
