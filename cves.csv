CVE-2025-46815,The identity infrastructure software ZITADEL offers developers the ability to manage user sessions using the Session API. This API enables the use of IdPs for authentication known as idp intents. Following a successful idp intent the client receives an id and token on a predefined URI. These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session. However prior to versions 3.0.0 2.71.9 and 2.70.10 it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed an attacker with access to the application’s URI to retrieve the id and token enabling them to authenticate on behalf of the user. It's important to note that the use of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and consequently access to the ZITADEL API. Versions 3.0.0 2.71.9 and 2.70.10 contain a fix for the issue. No known workarounds other than upgrading are available.,8.0,CWE-294

CVE-2023-37259,matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin restricting the impact.

CVE-2025-49847,llama.cpp is an inference of several LLM models in C/C++. Prior to version b5662 an attacker‐supplied GGUF model vocabulary can trigger a buffer overflow in llama.cpp’s vocabulary‐loading code. Specifically the helper _try_copy in llama.cpp/src/vocab.cpp: llama_vocab::impl::token_to_piece() casts a very large size_t token length into an int32_t causing the length check (if (length < (int32_t)size)) to be bypassed.

CVE-2024-4343,A Python command injection vulnerability exists in the `SagemakerLLM` class's `complete()` method within `./private_gpt/components/llm/custom/sagemaker.py` of the imartinez/privategpt application versions up to and including 0.3.0. The vulnerability arises due to the use of the `eval()` function to parse a string received from a remote AWS SageMaker LLM endpoint into a dictionary. This method of parsing is unsafe as it can execute arbitrary Python code contained within the response. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the response from the AWS SageMaker LLM endpoint to include malicious Python code leading to potential execution of arbitrary commands on the system hosting the application. The issue is fixed in version 0.6.0.,9.8,CWE-78
CVE-2024-23825,TablePress is a table plugin for Wordpress. For importing tables TablePress makes external HTTP requests based on a URL that is provided by the user. That user input is filtered insufficiently which makes it is possible to send requests to unintended network locations and receive responses. On sites in a cloud environment like AWS an attacker can potentially make GET requests to the instance's metadata REST API. If the instance's configuration is insecure this can lead to the exposure of internal data including credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.5.,3.0,CWE-918
CVE-2024-9666,A vulnerability was found in the Keycloak Server. The Keycloak Server is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to improper handling of proxy headers. When Keycloak is configured to accept incoming proxy headers it may accept non-IP values such as obfuscated identifiers without proper validation. This issue can lead to costly DNS resolution operations which an attacker could exploit to tie up IO threads and potentially cause a denial of service. The attacker must have access to send requests to a Keycloak instance that is configured to accept proxy headers specifically when reverse proxies do not overwrite incoming headers and Keycloak is configured to trust these headers.,4.7,CWE-444

An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-21255.,8.0,CWE-78
CVE-2023-34230,snowflake-connector-net the Snowflake Connector for .NET is vulnerable to command injection prior to version 2.0.18 via SSO URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue.,7.3,CWE-77

CVE-2022-49376,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: sd: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference  If sd_probe() sees an early error before sdkp->device is initialized sd_zbc_release_disk() is called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when sd_is_zoned() is called inside that function. Avoid this by removing the call to sd_zbc_release_disk() in sd_probe() error path.  This change is safe and does not result in zone information memory leakage because the zone information for a zoned disk is allocated only when sd_revalidate_disk() is called at which point sdkp->disk_dev is fully set resulting in sd_disk_release() being called when needed to cleanup a disk zone information using sd_zbc_release_disk().,5.5,CWE-476
