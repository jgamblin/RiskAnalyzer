CVE-2022-41952,Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will attempt to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting connection time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server (for instance Icecast). This can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is for example posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not supported and always fails 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0 to fully resolve the issue. As a workaround turn off URL preview functionality by setting `url_preview_enabled: false` in the Synapse configuration file.,6.5,CWE-400

CVE-2023-52501,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Do not attempt to read past commit  When iterating over the ring buffer while the ring buffer is active the writer can corrupt the reader. There's barriers to help detect this and handle it but that code missed the case where the last event was at the very end of the page and has only 4 bytes left.  The checks to detect the corruption by the writer to reads needs to see the length of the event. If the length in the first 4 bytes is zero then the length is stored in the second 4 bytes. But if the writer is in the process of updating that code there's a small window where the length in the first 4 bytes could be zero even though the length is only 4 bytes. That will cause rb_event_length() to read the next 4 bytes which could happen to be off the allocated page.  To protect against this fail immediately if the next event pointer is less than 8 bytes from the end of the commit (last byte of data) as all events must be a minimum of 8 bytes anyway.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2023-45666,stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images.  It may look like `stbi__load_gif_main` doesn’t give guarantees about the content of output value `*delays` upon failure. Although it sets `*delays` to zero at the beginning it doesn’t do it in case the image is not recognized as GIF and a call to `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` only frees possibly allocated memory in `*delays` without resetting it to zero. Thus it would be fair to say the caller of `stbi__load_gif_main` is responsible to free the allocated memory in `*delays` only if `stbi__load_gif_main` returns a non null value. However at the same time the function may return null value but fail to free the memory in `*delays` if internally `stbi__convert_format` is called and fails. Thus the issue may lead to a memory leak if the caller chooses to free `delays` only when `stbi__load_gif_main` didn’t fail or to a double-free if the `delays` is always freed,7.3,CWE-415

CVE-2025-24787,WhoDB is an open source database management tool. In affected versions the application is vulnerable to parameter injection in database connection strings which allows an attacker to read local files on the machine the application is running on. The application uses string concatenation to build database connection URIs which are then passed to corresponding libraries responsible for setting up the database connections. This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user in many cases to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true` the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one) the attacker is able to read local files. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.6,CWE-943

CVE-2024-43801,Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. The Jellyfin user profile image upload accepts SVG files allowing for a stored XSS attack against an admin user via a specially crafted malicious SVG file. When viewed by an admin outside of the Jellyfin Web UI (e.g. via view image in a browser) this malicious SVG file could interact with the browser's LocalStorage and retrieve an AccessToken which in turn can be used in an API call to elevate the target user to a Jellyfin administrator. The actual attack vector is unlikely to be exploited as it requires specific actions by the administrator to view the SVG image outside of Jellyfin's WebUI i.e. it is not a passive attack. The underlying exploit mechanism is solved by PR #12490 which forces attached images (including the potential malicious SVG) to be treated as attachments and thus downloaded by browsers rather than viewed. This prevents exploitation of the LocalStorage of the browser. This PR has been merged and the relevant code changes are included in release version 10.9.10.

CVE-2023-31127,libspdm is a sample implementation that follows the DMTF SPDM specifications. A vulnerability has been identified in SPDM session establishment in libspdm prior to version 2.3.1. If a device supports both DHE session and PSK session with mutual authentication the attacker may be able to establish the session with `KEY_EXCHANGE` and `PSK_FINISH` to bypass the mutual authentication. This is most likely to happen when the Requester begins a session using one method (DHE for example) and then uses the other method's finish (PSK_FINISH in this example) to establish the session. The session hashes would be expected to fail in this case but the condition was not detected.  This issue only impacts the SPDM responder which supports `KEY_EX_CAP=1 and `PSK_CAP=10b` at same time with mutual authentication requirement. The SPDM requester is not impacted. The SPDM responder is not impacted if `KEY_EX_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=01b`. The SPDM responder is not impacted if mutual authentication is not required.  libspdm 1.0 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 are all impacted. Older branches are not maintained but users of the 2.3 branch may receive a patch in version 2.3.2. The SPDM specification (DSP0274) does not contain this vulnerability.,9.0,CWE-287
