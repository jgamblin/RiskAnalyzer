The Tauri IPC is usually strictly isolated from external websites but in versions 1.0.0 until 1.0.9 1.1.0 until 1.1.4 and 1.2.0 until 1.2.5 the isolation can be bypassed by redirecting an existing Tauri window to an external website. This is either possible by an application implementing a feature for users to visit arbitrary websites or due to a bug allowing the open redirect. This allows the external website access to the IPC layer and therefore to all configured and exposed Tauri API endpoints and application specific implemented Tauri commands. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.9 1.1.4 and 1.2.5. As a workaround prevent arbitrary input in redirect features and/or only allow trusted websites access to the IPC.,4.8,CWE-601

CVE-2025-47950,CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. In versions prior to 1.12.2 a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams` which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size` which Introduces a server-wide bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in the Corefile use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2023-33977,Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and automated testing. Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans test cases etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files from being uploaded and Content-Security-Policy definition to prevent cross-site-scripting attacks. The upload validation checks were not 100% robust which left the possibility to circumvent them and upload a potentially dangerous file which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. Additionally we've discovered that Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive will strip some headers negating protections built into Kiwi TCMS when served behind a reverse proxy. This issue has been addressed in version 12.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade who are serving Kiwi TCMS behind a reverse proxy should make sure that additional header values are still passed to the client browser. If they aren't redefining them inside the proxy configuration.,8.1,CWE-79

CVE-2023-24813,Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter written in php. Due to the difference in the attribute parser of Dompdf and php-svg-lib an attacker can still call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols. Dompdf parses the href attribute of `image` tags and respects `xlink:href` even if `href` is specified. However php-svg-lib which is later used to parse the svg file parses the href attribute. Since `href` is respected if both `xlink:href` and `href` is specified it's possible to bypass the protection on the Dompdf side by providing an empty `xlink:href` attribute. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols if they provide an SVG file to the Dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0 it leads to arbitrary unserialize which will lead at the very least to arbitrary file deletion and might lead to remote code execution depending on available classes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `95009ea98` which has been included in release version 2.0.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,10.0,CWE-436

CVE-2022-0866,This is a concurrency issue that can result in the wrong caller principal being returned from the session context of an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal. In particular the org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.EJBComponent class has an incomingRunAsIdentity field. This field is used by the org.jboss.as.ejb3.security.RunAsPrincipalInterceptor to keep track of the current identity prior to switching to a new identity created using the RunAs principal. The exploit consist that the EJBComponent#incomingRunAsIdentity field is currently just a SecurityIdentity. This means in a concurrent environment where multiple users are repeatedly invoking an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal it's possible for the wrong the caller principal to be returned from EJBComponent#getCallerPrincipal. Similarly it's also possible for EJBComponent#isCallerInRole to return the wrong value. Both of these methods rely on incomingRunAsIdentity.

CVE-2023-27484,crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. In affected versions an already highly privileged user able to create or update Compositions can specify an arbitrarily high index in a patch's `ToFieldPath` which could lead to excessive memory usage once such Composition is selected for a Composite resource. Compositions allow users to specify patches inserting elements into arrays at an arbitrary index. When a Composition is selected for a Composite Resource patches are evaluated and if a specified index is greater than the current size of the target slice Crossplane will grow that slice up to the specified index which could lead to an excessive amount of memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed. The index is already capped to the maximum value for a uint32 (4294967295) when parsed but that is still an unnecessarily large value. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.11.2 1.10.3 and 1.9.2. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-37309,CrateDB is a distributed SQL database. A high-risk vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 5.7.2 where the TLS endpoint (port 4200) permits client-initiated renegotiation. In this scenario an attacker can exploit this feature to repeatedly request renegotiation of security parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources resulting in potential server overload and service disruption. The vulnerability was confirmed using an openssl client where the command `R` initiates renegotiation followed by the server confirming with `RENEGOTIATING`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU resources through repeated TLS renegotiations. This impacts the availability of services running on the affected server posing a significant risk to operational stability and security. TLS 1.3 explicitly forbids renegotiation since it closes a window of opportunity for an attack. Version 5.7.2 of CrateDB contains the fix for the issue. ,5.3,CWE-770

CVE-2022-49761,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: always report error in run_one_delayed_ref()  Currently we have a btrfs_debug() for run_one_delayed_ref() failure but if end users hit such problem there will be no chance that btrfs_debug() is enabled.  This can lead to very little useful info for debugging.  This patch will:  - Add extra info for error reporting   Including:   * logical bytenr   * num_bytes   * type   * action   * ref_mod  - Replace the btrfs_debug() with btrfs_err()  - Move the error reporting into run_one_delayed_ref()   This is to avoid use-after-free the @node can be freed in the caller.  This error should only be triggered at most once.  As if run_one_delayed_ref() failed we trigger the error message then causing the call chain to error out:  btrfs_run_delayed_refs() `- btrfs_run_delayed_refs()    `- btrfs_run_delayed_refs_for_head()       `- run_one_delayed_ref()  And we will abort the current transaction in btrfs_run_delayed_refs().
