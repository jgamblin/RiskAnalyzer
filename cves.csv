CVE-2022-31100,rulex is a new portable regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions rulex may crash possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash because rulex tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result.

CVE-2023-52811,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ibmvfc: Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event pool  In practice the driver should never send more commands than are allocated to a queue's event pool. In the unlikely event that this happens the code asserts a BUG_ON and in the case that the kernel is not configured to crash on panic returns a junk event pointer from the empty event list causing things to spiral from there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifact of the ibmvfc driver first being upstreamed and it is well known now that the use of BUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverable scenario. There is nothing about this scenario that prevents the driver from recovering and carrying on.  Remove the BUG_ON in question from ibmvfc_get_event() and return a NULL pointer in the case of an empty event pool. Update all call sites to ibmvfc_get_event() to check for a NULL pointer and perfrom the appropriate failure or recovery action.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-45809,Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Jwt filter will lead to an Envoy crash when clear route cache with remote JWKs. In the following case: 1. remote JWKs are used which requires async header processing; 2. clear_route_cache is enabled on the provider; 3. header operations are enabled in JWT filter e.g. header to claims feature; 4. the routing table is configured in a way that the JWT header operations modify requests to not match any route. When these conditions are met a crash is triggered in the upstream code due to nullptr reference conversion from route(). The root cause is the ordering of continueDecoding and clearRouteCache. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2 1.30.6 and 1.29.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.3,CWE-119

CVE-2025-46340,Misskey is an open source federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1 due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview` it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.,7.2,CWE-20

CVE-2023-45666,stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images.  It may look like `stbi__load_gif_main` doesn’t give guarantees about the content of output value `*delays` upon failure. Although it sets `*delays` to zero at the beginning it doesn’t do it in case the image is not recognized as GIF and a call to `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` only frees possibly allocated memory in `*delays` without resetting it to zero. Thus it would be fair to say the caller of `stbi__load_gif_main` is responsible to free the allocated memory in `*delays` only if `stbi__load_gif_main` returns a non null value. However at the same time the function may return null value but fail to free the memory in `*delays` if internally `stbi__convert_format` is called and fails. Thus the issue may lead to a memory leak if the caller chooses to free `delays` only when `stbi__load_gif_main` didn’t fail or to a double-free if the `delays` is always freed,7.3,CWE-415
