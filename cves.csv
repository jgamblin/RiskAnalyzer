CVE-2025-62523,PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton. PILOS before 4.8.0 includes a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration in its middleware: it reflects the Origin request header back in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header without proper validation or a whitelist while Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is set to true. This behavior could allow a malicious website on a different origin to send requests (including credentials) to the PILOS API. This may enable exfiltration or actions using the victim’s credentials if the server accepts those cross-origin requests as authenticated. Laravel’s session handling applies additional origin checks such that cross-origin requests are not authenticated by default. Because of these session-origin protections and in the absence of any other unknown vulnerabilities that would bypass Laravel’s origin/session checks this reflected-Origin CORS misconfiguration is not believed to be exploitable in typical PILOS deployments. This vulnerability has been patched in PILOS in v4.8.0,6.3,CWE-942

CVE-2022-49554,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  zsmalloc: fix races between asynchronous zspage free and page migration  The asynchronous zspage free worker tries to lock a zspage's entire page list without defending against page migration.  Since pages which haven't yet been locked can concurrently migrate off the zspage page list while lock_zspage() churns away lock_zspage() can suffer from a few different lethal races.  It can lock a page which no longer belongs to the zspage and unsafely dereference page_private() it can unsafely dereference a torn pointer to the next page (since there's a data race) and it can observe a spurious NULL pointer to the next page and thus not lock all of the zspage's pages (since a single page migration will reconstruct the entire page list and create_page_chain() unconditionally zeroes out each list pointer in the process).  Fix the races by using migrate_read_lock() in lock_zspage() to synchronize with page migration.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2021-47008,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating  Access to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the GHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCB might not be mapped.  The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered. However if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold then the GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT) which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.  The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about any errors. While it is likely that the GHCB will be mapped in this situation add a safe guard in this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-24734,MyBB is a free and open source forum software. In affected versions the Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update making it possible to add settings of supported type `php` with PHP code executed on on _Change Settings_ pages. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the `Can manage settings?` permission. MyBB's Settings module which allows administrators to add edit and delete non-default settings stores setting data in an options code string ($options_code; mybb_settings.optionscode database column) that identifies the setting type and its options separated by a new line character (\n). In MyBB 1.2.0 support for setting type php was added for which the remaining part of the options code is PHP code executed on Change Settings pages (reserved for plugins and internal use). MyBB 1.8.30 resolves this issue. There are no known workarounds.,7.2,CWE-94

CVE-2023-36827,Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. A path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability affects fides versions lower than version `2.15.1` allowing remote attackers to access arbitrary files on the fides webserver container's filesystem. The vulnerability is patched in fides `2.15.1`.  If the Fides webserver API is not directly accessible to attackers and is instead deployed behind a reverse proxy as recommended in Ethyca's security best practice documentation and the reverse proxy is an AWS application load balancer the vulnerability can't be exploited by these attackers. An AWS application load balancer will reject this attack with a 400 error. Additionally any secrets supplied to the container using environment variables rather than a `fides.toml` configuration file are not affected by this vulnerability. ,7.5,CWE-22
CVE-2023-38499,TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system.
