CVE-2022-49371,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  driver core: fix deadlock in __device_attach  In __device_attach function The lock holding logic is as follows: ... __device_attach device_lock(dev)      // get lock dev   async_schedule_dev(__device_attach_async_helper dev); // func     async_schedule_node       async_schedule_node_domain(func)         entry = kzalloc(sizeof(struct async_entry) GFP_ATOMIC); 	/* when fail or work limit sync to execute func but 	   __device_attach_async_helper will get lock dev as 	   well which will lead to A-A deadlock.  */ 	if (!entry || atomic_read(&entry_count) > MAX_WORK) { 	  func; 	else 	  queue_work_node(node system_unbound_wq &entry->work)   device_unlock(dev)  As shown above when it is allowed to do async probes because of out of memory or work limit async work is not allowed to do sync execute instead. it will lead to A-A deadlock because of __device_attach_async_helper getting lock dev.  To fix the deadlock move the async_schedule_dev outside device_lock as we can see in async_schedule_node_domain the parameter of queue_work_node is system_unbound_wq so it can accept concurrent operations. which will also not change the code logic and will not lead to deadlock.,5.5,CWE-667
