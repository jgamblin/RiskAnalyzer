CVE-2024-39506,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  liquidio: Adjust a NULL pointer handling path in lio_vf_rep_copy_packet  In lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() pg_info->page is compared to a NULL value but then it is unconditionally passed to skb_add_rx_frag() which looks strange and could lead to null pointer dereference.  lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() call trace looks like: 	octeon_droq_process_packets 	 octeon_droq_fast_process_packets 	  octeon_droq_dispatch_pkt 	   octeon_create_recv_info 	    ...search in the dispatch_list... 	     ->disp_fn(rdisp->rinfo ...) 	      lio_vf_rep_pkt_recv(struct octeon_recv_info *recv_info ...) In this path there is no code which sets pg_info->page to NULL. So this check looks unneeded and doesn't solve potential problem. But I guess the author had reason to add a check and I have no such card and can't do real test. In addition the code in the function liquidio_push_packet() in liquidio/lio_core.c does exactly the same.  Based on this I consider the most acceptable compromise solution to adjust this issue by moving skb_add_rx_frag() into conditional scope.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-52895,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/poll: don't reissue in case of poll race on multishot request  A previous commit fixed a poll race that can occur but it's only applicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request we can safely ignore a spurious wakeup as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.  A blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a buffer if they are ring provided.

CVE-2023-28628,lambdaisland/uri is a pure Clojure/ClojureScript URI library. In versions prior to 1.14.120 `authority-regex` allows an attacker to send malicious URLs to be parsed by the `lambdaisland/uri` and return the wrong authority. This issue is similar to but distinct from CVE-2020-8910. The regex in question doesn't handle the backslash (`\`) character in the username correctly leading to a wrong output. ex. a payload of `https://example.com\\@google.com` would return that the host is `google.com` but the correct host should be `example.com`.

CVE-2024-20657,Windows Group Policy Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability,7.0,CWE-284
CVE-2024-42358,PDFio is a simple C library for reading and writing PDF files. There is a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in the TTF parser. Maliciously crafted TTF files can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. This can also lead to a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability. An infinite loop occurs in the read_camp function by nGroups value. The ttf.h library is vulnerable. A value called nGroups is extracted from the file and by changing that value you can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. If the value of nGroups in the file is small an infinite loop will not occur. This library whether used as a standalone binary or as part of another application is vulnerable to DOS attacks when parsing certain types of files. Automated systems including web servers that use this code to convert PDF submissions into plaintext can be DOSed if an attacker uploads a malicious TTF file. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.2,CWE-835

CVE-2023-38697,protocol-http1 provides a low-level implementation of the HTTP/1 protocol. RFC 9112 Section 7.1 defined the format of chunk size chunk data and chunk extension. The value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits the chunk size should be a string of hex digits and should split from chunk data using CRLF and the chunk extension shouldn't contain any invisible character. However Falcon has following behaviors while disobey the corresponding RFCs: accepting Content-Length header values that have `+` prefix accepting Content-Length header values that written in hexadecimal with `0x` prefix accepting `0x` and `+` prefixed chunk size and accepting LF in chunk extension. This behavior can lead to desync when forwarding through multiple HTTP parsers potentially results in HTTP request smuggling and firewall bypassing. This issue is fixed in `protocol-http1` v0.15.1.

CVE-2023-50291,Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.  This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2 from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0. One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties /admin/info/properties was only setup to hide system properties that had password contained in the name. There are a number of sensitive system properties such as basicauth and aws.secretKey do not contain password thus their values were published via the /admin/info/properties endpoint. This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.  This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the config-read permission. Therefore Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the config-read permission. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3 which fixes the issue. A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints -Dsolr.hiddenSysProps. By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including -Dbasicauth) as well as any property with a name containing secret or password.  Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:   '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*',7.5,CWE-522

CVE-2025-20151,A vulnerability in the implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated remote attacker to poll an affected device using SNMP even if the device is configured to deny SNMP traffic from an unauthorized source or the SNMPv3 username is removed from the configuration.    This vulnerability exists because of the way that the SNMPv3 configuration is stored in the Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software startup configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by polling an affected device from a source address that should have been denied. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP operations from a source that should be denied.  Note: The attacker has no control of the SNMPv3 configuration. To exploit this vulnerability the attacker must have valid SNMPv3 user credentials.  For more information see the  section of this advisory.,4.3,CWE-16

The FjGabiFlashCoreAbstractionSmm driver registers a Software System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler that is not sufficiently validated to ensure that the CommBuffer (or any other communication buffer's nested contents) are not pointing to SMRAM contents. A potential attacker can therefore write fixed data to SMRAM which could lead to data corruption inside this memory (e.g. change the SMI handler's code or modify SMRAM map structures to break input pointer validation for other SMI handlers). Thus the attacker could elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2 and execute arbitrary code in SMM.,7.8,CWE-787
