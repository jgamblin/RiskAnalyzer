CVE-2024-26678,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section  The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from 32-bit firmware (i.e. CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)  This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the loader and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image to avoid the need for padding it to 4k which is required for sections appearing in the middle of the image.  Unfortunately this violates the PE/COFF spec and even if most EFI loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference implementation) PE loaders do exist that reject such images on the basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner without leaving any gaps.  So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slight padding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling CONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days),5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2023-30548,gatsby-plugin-sharp is a plugin for the gatsby framework which exposes functions built on the Sharp image processing library. The gatsby-plugin-sharp plugin prior to versions 5.8.1 and 4.25.1 contains a path traversal vulnerability exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`). It should be noted that by default gatsby develop is only accessible via the localhost 127.0.0.1 and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as --host 0.0.0.0 -H 0.0.0.0 or the GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0 environment variable. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability will have read access to all files within the scope of the server process. A patch has been introduced in gatsby-plugin-sharp@5.8.1 and gatsby-plugin-sharp@4.25.1 which mitigates the issue by ensuring that included paths remain within the project directory. As stated above by default gatsby develop is only exposed to the localhost 127.0.0.1. For those using the develop server in the default configuration no risk is posed. If other ranges are required preventing the develop server from being exposed to untrusted interfaces or IP address ranges would mitigate the risk from this vulnerability. Users are non the less encouraged to upgrade to a safe version.,4.3,CWE-22

CVE-2023-35926,Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires sandbox as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2` but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities  that may not have a fix the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library. A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.,8.0,CWE-94

CVE-2025-24814,Core creation allows users to replace trusted configset files with arbitrary configuration  Solr instances that (1) use the FileSystemConfigSetService component (the default in standalone or user-managed mode) and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual trusted configset files can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.  These replacement config files are treated as trusted and can use <lib> tags to add to Solr's classpath which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.  This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from FileSystemConfigSetService).  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0 which mitigates this issue by disabling use of <lib> tags by default.,5.5,CWE-250

CVE-2022-46177,Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches when a user requests for a password reset link email then changes their primary email the old reset email is still valid.

If the old email address is compromised or has transferred ownership this leads to an account takeover. This is however mitigated by the SiteSetting `email_token_valid_hours` which is currently 48 hours. Users should upgrade to versions 2.8.14 or 3.0.0.beta15 to receive a patch. As a workaround lower `email_token_valid_hours ` as needed.,5.7,CWE-613

CVE-2023-45137,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` starting in version 3.1-milestone-2 and prior to version 13.4-rc-1 as well as `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` prior to versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. When trying to create a document that already exists XWiki displays an error message in the form for creating it.

Prior to versions 2.20.6 2.19.6 and 2.18.7 anonymous users can obtain sensitive information about GeoNode configurations from the response of the `/geoserver/rest/about/status` Geoserver REST API endpoint. The Geoserver endpoint is secured by default but the configuration of Geoserver for GeoNode opens a list of REST endpoints to support some of its public-facing services. The vulnerability impacts both GeoNode 3 and GeoNode 4 instances.  Geoserver security configuration is provided by `geoserver-geonode-ext`. A patch for 2.20.7 has been released which blocks access to the affected endpoint. The patch has been backported to branches 2.20.6 2.19.7 2.19.6 and 2.18.7. All the published artifacts and Docker images have been updated accordingly. A more advanced patch has been applied to the master and development versions which require some changes to GeoNode code. They will be available with the next 4.1.0 release. The patched configuration only has an effect on new deployments. For existing setups the patch must be applied manually inside the Geoserver data directory. The patched file must replace the existing `<geoserver_datadir>/security/rest.properties` file.,7.5,CWE-200

CVE-2022-31183,fs2 is a compositional streaming I/O library for Scala. When establishing a server-mode `TLSSocket` using `fs2-io` on Node.js the parameter `requestCert = true` is ignored peer certificate verification is skipped and the connection proceeds. The vulnerability is limited to: 1. `fs2-io` running on Node.js. The JVM TLS implementation is completely independent. 2. `TLSSocket`s in server-mode.

CVE-2024-57953,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: tps6594: Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems  The problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset()  	tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;  The tmp variable is an s64 but offset is a long in the (-277774)-277774 range.  On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to approximately two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large (32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million.  When you start multiplying by a hundred million it doesn't take long to overflow the two billion mark.  Probably the safest way to fix this is to change the type of TICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because it's such a large number.,5.5,CWE-190
