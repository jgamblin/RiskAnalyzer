CVE-2024-26729,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srv  Fixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in the dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() functions.  In both functions the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferenced before it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null.

CVE-2022-24798,Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected.

CVE-2023-52627,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events  AD7091R-5 devices are supported by the ad7091r-5 driver together with the ad7091r-base driver. Those drivers declared iio events for notifying user space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limit registers or above the values set in high limit registers. However to configure iio events and their thresholds a set of callback functions must be implemented and those were not present until now. The consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without the proper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernel because the pointers to the callback functions were not set.  Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/write event thresholds and enable/disable event generation.  Since the event spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices also move those from the ad7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reused when support for ad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-41125,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-ber.c module where the function snmp_ber_decode_string_len_buffer decodes the string length from a received SNMP packet.

CVE-2024-26846,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-fc: do not wait in vain when unloading module  The module exit path has race between deleting all controllers and freeing 'left over IDs'. To prevent double free a synchronization between nvme_delete_ctrl and ida_destroy has been added by the initial commit.  There is some logic around trying to prevent from hanging forever in wait_for_completion though it does not handling all cases. E.g. blktests is able to reproduce the situation where the module unload hangs forever.  If we completely rely on the cleanup code executed from the nvme_delete_ctrl path all IDs will be freed eventually. This makes calling ida_destroy unnecessary. We only have to ensure that all nvme_delete_ctrl code has been executed before we leave nvme_fc_exit_module. This is done by flushing the nvme_delete_wq workqueue.  While at it remove the unused nvme_fc_wq workqueue too.,4.4,CWE-415

NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.,8.8,CWE-121
CVE-2024-26884,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches  The hashtab code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of hash buckets and contains an overflow check by checking if the resulting value is 0. However on 32-bit arches the roundup code itself can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value which is undefined behaviour so it is not guaranteed to truncate neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type which contains the same check copied from the hashtab code. So apply the same fix to hashtab by moving the overflow check to before the roundup.,7.8,CWE-119

CVE-2025-24359,ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6 if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.,8.4,CWE-134

CVE-2023-28114,`cilium-cli` is the command line interface to install manage and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters running Cilium. Prior to version 0.13.2`cilium-cli` when used to configure cluster mesh functionality can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote clusters. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected by this issue.  Due to an incorrect mount point specification the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that `etcd` cluster.  This issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2. As a workaround one may use Cilium's Helm charts to create their cluster.,4.8,CWE-280

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with access to a subscriber-level account to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. NOTE: This vulnerability can be successfully exploited on a vulnerable WordPress instance against an OAuth pre-authenticated higher-level user (e.g. administrator) by leveraging a cross-site request forgery in conjunction with a certain social engineering technique to achieve a critical impact scenario (cross-site scripting to administrator-level account creation). However successful exploitation requires Debug mode to be enabled in the plugin's Global Settings.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2024-32647,Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and prior using the `create_from_blueprint` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when `raw_args=True` and the `args` argument has side-effects. It can be seen that the `_build_create_IR` function of the `create_from_blueprint` builtin doesn't cache the mentioned `args` argument to the stack. As such it can be evaluated multiple times (instead of retrieving the value from the stack). No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such the impact is low. As of time of publication no fixed versions exist. ,5.3,CWE-95

CVE-2023-43634, When sealing/unsealing the “vault” key a list of PCRs is used which defines which PCRs are used.  In a previous project CYMOTIVE found that the configuration is not protected by the secure boot and in response Zededa implemented measurements on the config partition that was mapped to PCR 13.  In that process PCR 13 was added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key.  In commit “56e589749c6ff58ded862d39535d43253b249acf” the config partition measurement moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14 but PCR 14 was not added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key.  This change makes the measurement of PCR 14 effectively redundant as it would not affect the sealing/unsealing of the key.    An attacker could modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot this could result in the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents of the encrypted “vault”     ,8.8,CWE-522
