CVE-2024-35804,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: Mark target gfn of emulated atomic instruction as dirty  When emulating an atomic access on behalf of the guest mark the target gfn dirty if the CMPXCHG by KVM is attempted and doesn't fault.  This fixes a bug where KVM effectively corrupts guest memory during live migration by writing to guest memory without informing userspace that the page is dirty.  Marking the page dirty got unintentionally dropped when KVM's emulated CMPXCHG was converted to do a user access.  Before that KVM explicitly mapped the guest page into kernel memory and marked the page dirty during the unmap phase.  Mark the page dirty even if the CMPXCHG fails as the old data is written back on failure i.e. the page is still written.  The value written is guaranteed to be the same because the operation is atomic but KVM's ABI is that all writes are dirty logged regardless of the value written.  And more importantly that's what KVM did before the buggy commit.  Huge kudos to the folks on the Cc list (and many others) who did all the actual work of triaging and debugging.  base-commit: 6769ea8da8a93ed4630f1ce64df6aafcaabfce64,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2023-34455,snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to use of an unchecked chunk length an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1.  The code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn’t possible to read the 4 bytes the function returns false. Otherwise if 4 bytes were available the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.  In the case that the `compressed` variable is null a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn’t test the legality of the `chunkSize` variable it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1) which will cause the code to raise a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF) which would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.  Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2025-21915,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cdx: Fix possible UAF error in driver_override_show()  Fixed a possible UAF problem in driver_override_show() in drivers/cdx/cdx.c  This function driver_override_show() is part of DEVICE_ATTR_RW which includes both driver_override_show() and driver_override_store(). These functions can be executed concurrently in sysfs.  The driver_override_store() function uses driver_set_override() to update the driver_override value and driver_set_override() internally locks the device (device_lock(dev)). If driver_override_show() reads cdx_dev->driver_override without locking it could potentially access a freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string concurrently. This could lead to printing a kernel address which is a security risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read by all users.  Additionally a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c as well as many other bus drivers where device_lock() is taken in the show function and it has been working without issues.  This potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis tool which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify data races and atomicity violations.,7.8,CWE-416
