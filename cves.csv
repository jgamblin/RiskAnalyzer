CVE-2023-5562,An unsafe default configuration in KNIME Analytics Platform before 5.2.0 allows for a cross-site scripting attack. When KNIME Analytics Platform is used as an executor for either KNIME Server or KNIME Business Hub several JavaScript-based view nodes do not sanitize the data that is displayed by default. If the data to be displayed contains JavaScript this code is executed in the browser and can perform any operations that the current user is allowed to perform silently.     KNIME Analytics Platform already has configuration options with which sanitization of data can be actived see  https://docs.knime.com/latest/webportal_admin_guide/index.html#html-sanitization-webportal https://docs.knime.com/latest/webportal_admin_guide/index.html#html-sanitization-webportal . However these are off by default which allows for cross-site scripting attacks.   KNIME Analytics Platform 5.2.0 will enable sanitization by default. For all previous releases we recommend users to add the corresponding settings to the executor's knime.ini.   ,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2024-5443,CVE-2024-4320 describes a vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms software specifically within the `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()` function. The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure.

CVE-2024-37300,OAuthenticator is software that allows OAuth2 identity providers to be plugged in and used with JupyterHub. JupyterHub < 5.0 when used with `GlobusOAuthenticator` could be configured to allow all users from a particular institution only. This worked fine prior to JupyterHub 5.0 because `allow_all` did not take precedence over `identity_provider`. Since JupyterHub 5.0 `allow_all` does take precedence over `identity_provider`. On a hub with the same config now all users will be allowed to login regardless of `identity_provider`. `identity_provider` will basically be ignored. This is a documented change in JupyterHub 5.0 but is likely to catch many users by surprise. OAuthenticator 16.3.1 fixes the issue with JupyterHub 5.0 and does not affect previous versions.

CVE-2023-28630,GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. In GoCD versions from 20.5.0 and below 23.1.0 if the server environment is not correctly configured by administrators to provide access to the relevant PostgreSQL or MySQL backup tools the credentials for database access may be unintentionally leaked to admin alerts on the GoCD user interface. The vulnerability is triggered only if the GoCD server host is misconfigured to have backups enabled but does not have access to the `pg_dump` or `mysqldump` utility tools to backup the configured database type (PostgreSQL or MySQL respectively). In such cases failure to launch the expected backup utility reports the shell environment used to attempt to launch in the server admin alert which includes the plaintext database password supplied to the configured tool. This vulnerability does not affect backups of the default on-disk H2 database that GoCD is configured to use. This issue has been addressed and fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable backups or administrators should ensure that the required `pg_dump` (PostgreSQL) or `mysqldump` (MySQL) binaries are available on the GoCD server when backups are triggered.,4.2,CWE-532

CVE-2022-23597,Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms with Element Web at its core. Element Desktop before 1.9.7 is vulnerable to a remote program execution bug with user interaction. The exploit is non-trivial and requires clicking on a malicious link followed by another button click. To the best of our knowledge the vulnerability has never been exploited in the wild. If you are using Element Desktop < 1.9.7 we recommend upgrading at your earliest convenience. If successfully exploited the vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a file path of a binary on the victim's computer which then gets executed. Notably the attacker does *not* have the ability to specify program arguments. However in certain unspecified configurations the attacker may be able to specify an URI instead of a file path which then gets handled using standard platform mechanisms. These may allow exploiting further vulnerabilities in those mechanisms potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.,8.3,CWE-416
