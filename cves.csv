CVE-2022-4304,A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack.

For example in a TLS connection RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.,5.9,CWE-203

CVE-2025-38085,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast race  huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have previously been shared across processes potentially turning it into a normal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can afterwards be installed.  If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast() gup_fast() could end up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see any way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption it is really weird and unexpected.  Fix it with an explicit broadcast IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one() just like we do in khugepaged when removing page tables for a THP collapse.,4.7,CWE-362

When `Conv2DBackpropInput` receives empty `out_backprop` inputs (e.g. `[3 1 0 1]`) the current CPU/GPU kernels `CHECK` fail (one with dnnl the other with cudnn). This can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 27a65a43cf763897fecfa5cdb5cc653fc5dd0346. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1 TensorFlow 2.8.1 and TensorFlow 2.7.2 as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,5.9,CWE-617

CVE-2025-62508,Citizen is a MediaWiki skin that makes extensions part of the cohesive experience. Citizen from 3.3.0 to 3.9.0 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in the sticky header button message handling.

CVE-2022-21668,pipenv is a Python development workflow tool. Starting with version 2018.10.9 and prior to version 2022.1.8 a flaw in pipenv's parsing of requirements files allows an attacker to insert a specially crafted string inside a comment anywhere within a requirements.txt file which will cause victims who use pipenv to install the requirements file to download dependencies from a package index server controlled by the attacker. By embedding malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server the attacker can trigger arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the victims' systems. If an attacker is able to hide a malicious `--index-url` option in a requirements file that a victim installs with pipenv the attacker can embed arbitrary malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server that will be executed on the victim's host during installation (remote code execution/RCE).

CVE-2024-55603,Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`) to store the session data in a database. Therefore when a `session_id` is given kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point it does not correctly verify if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus a session which's lifetime is already `> time()` is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function that does remove invalid sessions is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()` based on `session.gc_divisor` `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1 session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-613
