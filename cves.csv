CVE-2025-25195,Zulip is an open source team chat application. A weekly cron job (added in 50256f48314250978f521ef439cafa704e056539) demotes channels to being inactive after they have not received traffic for 180 days.  However upon doing so an event was sent to all users in the organization not just users in the channel.  This event contained the name of the private channel. Similarly the same commit (50256f48314250978f521ef439cafa704e056539) added functionality to notify clients when channels stopped being inactive.  The first message sent to a private channel which had not previously had any messages for over 180 days (and were thus already marked inactive) would leak an event to all users in the organization; this event also contained the name of the private channel. Commits 75be449d456d29fef27e9d1828bafa30174284b4 and a2a1a7f8d152296c8966f1380872c0ac69e5c87e fixed the issue.

CVE-2022-0866,This is a concurrency issue that can result in the wrong caller principal being returned from the session context of an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal. In particular the org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.EJBComponent class has an incomingRunAsIdentity field. This field is used by the org.jboss.as.ejb3.security.RunAsPrincipalInterceptor to keep track of the current identity prior to switching to a new identity created using the RunAs principal. The exploit consist that the EJBComponent#incomingRunAsIdentity field is currently just a SecurityIdentity. This means in a concurrent environment where multiple users are repeatedly invoking an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal it's possible for the wrong the caller principal to be returned from EJBComponent#getCallerPrincipal. Similarly it's also possible for EJBComponent#isCallerInRole to return the wrong value. Both of these methods rely on incomingRunAsIdentity.

CVE-2024-20267,A vulnerability with the handling of MPLS traffic for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the netstack process to unexpectedly restart which could cause the device to stop processing network traffic or to reload.     This vulnerability is due to lack of proper error checking when processing an ingress MPLS frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet that is encapsulated within an MPLS frame to an MPLS-enabled interface of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.    Note: The IPv6 packet can be generated multiple hops away from the targeted device and then encapsulated within MPLS. The DoS condition may occur when the NX-OS device processes the packet.,8.6,CWE-120

CVE-2025-68458,Webpack is a module bundler. From version 5.49.0 to before 5.104.1 when experiments.buildHttp is enabled webpack’s HTTP(S) resolver (HttpUriPlugin) can be bypassed to fetch resources from hosts outside allowedUris by using crafted URLs that include userinfo (username:password@host). If allowedUris enforcement relies on a raw string prefix check (e.g. uri.startsWith(allowed)) a URL that looks allow-listed can pass validation while the actual network request is sent to a different authority/host after URL parsing. This is a policy/allow-list bypass that enables build-time SSRF behavior (outbound requests from the build machine to internal-only endpoints depending on network access) and untrusted content inclusion (the fetched response is treated as module source and bundled). This issue has been patched in version 5.104.1.,3.7,CWE-918

CVE-2023-52517,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drain  Previously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to read any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is correct when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the transfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be transferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO still needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure and DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO corrupting any data read. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never adjusted according to DMA progress in DMA mode thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA mode is a bug. Fix corruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode. Also wait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to ensure all data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.,7.0,CWE-362

CVE-2023-41327,WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules where the allowed list is evaluated first.   Until WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15 the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock’s instance. For example If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token discovered using another exploit via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations.,4.6,CWE-918
