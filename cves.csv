CVE-2025-27143,Better Auth is an authentication and authorization library for TypeScript. Prior to version 1.1.21 the application is vulnerable to an open redirect due to improper validation of the callbackURL parameter in the email verification endpoint and any other endpoint that accepts callback url. While the server blocks fully qualified URLs it incorrectly allows scheme-less URLs. This results in the browser interpreting the URL as a fully qualified URL leading to unintended redirection. An attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious verification link and tricking users into clicking it. Upon successful email verification the user will be automatically redirected to the attacker's website which can be used for phishing malware distribution or stealing sensitive authentication tokens. This CVE is a bypass of the fix for GHSA-8jhw-6pjj-8723/CVE-2024-56734. Version 1.1.21 contains an updated patch.,6.1,CWE-601

CVE-2024-27303,electron-builder is a solution to package and build a ready for distribution Electron Proton Native app for macOS Windows and Linux. A vulnerability that only affects eletron-builder prior to 24.13.2 in Windows the NSIS installer makes a system call to open cmd.exe via NSExec in the `.nsh` installer script. NSExec by default searches the current directory of where the installer is located before searching `PATH`.

CVE-2023-40167,Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Prior to versions 9.4.52 10.0.16 11.0.16 and 12.0.1 Jetty accepts the `+` character proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field.

CVE-2022-39222,Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps. Dex instances with public clients (and by extension clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process.

CVE-2022-49187,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: Fix clk_hw_get_clk() when dev is NULL  Any registered clk_core structure can have a NULL pointer in its dev field. While never actually documented this is evidenced by the wide usage of clk_register and clk_hw_register with a NULL device pointer and the fact that the core of_clk_hw_register() function also passes a NULL device pointer.  A call to clk_hw_get_clk() on a clk_hw struct whose clk_core is in that case will result in a NULL pointer derefence when it calls dev_name() on that NULL device pointer.  Add a test for this case and use NULL as the dev_id if the device pointer is NULL.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-50711,vmm-sys-util is a collection of modules that provides helpers and utilities used by multiple rust-vmm components. Starting in version 0.5.0 and prior to version 0.12.0 an issue in the `FamStructWrapper::deserialize` implementation provided by the crate for `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does not check that the length stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods. The issue was corrected in version 0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal for any deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover the API was changed so that header length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds memory access from Rust-safe code.,5.7,CWE-787

CVE-2025-45388,Wagtail CMS 6.4.1 is vulnerable to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the document upload functionality. Attackers can inject malicious code inside a PDF file. When a user clicks the document in the CMS interface the payload executes. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because It has been well documented that when serving uploaded files using a method outside of Wagtail (which admittedly is the default) it requires additional configuration from the developer because Wagtail cannot control how these are served. ... For example if a Wagtail instance is configured to upload files into AWS S3 Wagtail cannot control the permissions on how they're served nor any headers used when serving them (a limitation of S3).,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2023-40013,SVG Loader is a javascript library that fetches SVGs using XMLHttpRequests and injects the SVG code in the tag's place. According to the docs svg-loader will strip all JS code before injecting the SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not sufficient and can be trivially bypassed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious SVG which can result in Cross-site Scripting (XSS). When trying to sanitize the svg the lib removes event attributes such as `onmouseover` `onclick` but the list of events is not exhaustive.  Any website which uses external-svg-loader and allows its users to provide svg src upload svg files would be susceptible to stored XSS attack. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3562fc08` which is included in releases from 1.6.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.1,CWE-79

CVE-2022-49376,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: sd: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference  If sd_probe() sees an early error before sdkp->device is initialized sd_zbc_release_disk() is called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when sd_is_zoned() is called inside that function. Avoid this by removing the call to sd_zbc_release_disk() in sd_probe() error path.  This change is safe and does not result in zone information memory leakage because the zone information for a zoned disk is allocated only when sd_revalidate_disk() is called at which point sdkp->disk_dev is fully set resulting in sd_disk_release() being called when needed to cleanup a disk zone information using sd_zbc_release_disk().,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-24376,kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register Kubewarden admission policies. By design AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup can evaluate only namespaced resources. The resources to be evaluated are determined by the rules provided by the user when defining the policy. There might be Kubernetes namespaced resources that should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies because of their sensitive nature. For example PolicyReport are namespaced resources that contain the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace. An attacker can use either an AdmissionPolicy or an AdmissionPolicyGroup to prevent the creation and update of PolicyReport objects to hide non-compliant resources. Moreover the same attacker might use a mutating AdmissionPolicy to alter the contents of the PolicyReport created inside of the namespace. Starting from the 1.21.0 release the validation rules applied to AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup have been tightened to prevent them from validating sensitive types of namespaced resources.,6.5,CWE-155

CVE-2025-3153,Concrete CMS version 9 below 9.4.0RC2 and versions below 8.5.20 are vulnerable to CSRF and XSS in the Concrete CMS Address attribute because addresses are not properly sanitized in the output when a country is not specified.  Attackers are limited to individuals whom a site administrator has granted the ability to fill in an address attribute. It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable.  The fix only sanitizes new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous versions; a database search is recommended.
