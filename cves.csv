CVE-2025-59936,get-jwks contains fetch utils for JWKS keys. In versions prior to 11.0.2 a vulnerability in get-jwks can lead to cache poisoning in the JWKS key-fetching mechanism. When the iss (issuer) claim is validated only after keys are retrieved from the cache it is possible for cached keys from an unexpected issuer to be reused resulting in a bypass of issuer validation. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a pair of JWTs the first one ensuring that a chosen public key is fetched and stored in the shared JWKS cache and the second one leveraging that cached key to pass signature validation for a targeted iss value. The vulnerability will work only if the iss validation is done after the use of get-jwks for keys retrieval. This issue has been patched in version 11.0.2.,9.4,CWE-116

CVE-2025-46327,gosnowflake is the Snowflake Golang driver. Versions starting from 1.7.0 to before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and macOS the Driver reads logging configuration from a user-provided file. On Linux and macOS the Driver verifies that the configuration file can be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition and failed to verify that the file owner matches the user running the Driver. This could allow a local attacker with write access to the configuration file or the directory containing it to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location. This issue has been patched in version 1.13.3.,3.3,CWE-367

CVE-2025-3153,Concrete CMS version 9 below 9.4.0RC2 and versions below 8.5.20 are vulnerable to CSRF and XSS in the Concrete CMS Address attribute because addresses are not properly sanitized in the output when a country is not specified.  Attackers are limited to individuals whom a site administrator has granted the ability to fill in an address attribute. It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable.  The fix only sanitizes new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous versions; a database search is recommended. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability CVSS v.4.0 score of 5.1  with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L Thanks Myq Larson for reporting.,6.5,CWE-79

CVE-2022-49761,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: always report error in run_one_delayed_ref()  Currently we have a btrfs_debug() for run_one_delayed_ref() failure but if end users hit such problem there will be no chance that btrfs_debug() is enabled.  This can lead to very little useful info for debugging.  This patch will:  - Add extra info for error reporting   Including:   * logical bytenr   * num_bytes   * type   * action   * ref_mod  - Replace the btrfs_debug() with btrfs_err()  - Move the error reporting into run_one_delayed_ref()   This is to avoid use-after-free the @node can be freed in the caller.  This error should only be triggered at most once.  As if run_one_delayed_ref() failed we trigger the error message then causing the call chain to error out:  btrfs_run_delayed_refs() `- btrfs_run_delayed_refs()    `- btrfs_run_delayed_refs_for_head()       `- run_one_delayed_ref()  And we will abort the current transaction in btrfs_run_delayed_refs(). If we have to run delayed refs for the abort transaction run_one_delayed_ref() will just cleanup the refs and do nothing thus no new error messages would be output.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2025-37893,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: BPF: Fix off-by-one error in build_prologue()  Vincent reported that running BPF progs with tailcalls on LoongArch causes kernel hard lockup. Debugging the issues shows that the JITed image missing a jirl instruction at the end of the epilogue.  There are two passes in JIT compiling the first pass set the flags and the second pass generates JIT code based on those flags. With BPF progs mixing bpf2bpf and tailcalls build_prologue() generates N insns in the first pass and then generates N+1 insns in the second pass.

CVE-2023-52531,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix a memory corruption issue  A few lines above space is kzalloc()'ed for: 	sizeof(struct iwl_nvm_data) + 	sizeof(struct ieee80211_channel) + 	sizeof(struct ieee80211_rate)  'mvm->nvm_data' is a 'struct iwl_nvm_data' so it is fine.  At the end of this structure there is the 'channels' flex array. Each element is of type 'struct ieee80211_channel'. So only 1 element is allocated in this array.  When doing:   mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].channels = mvm->nvm_data->channels; We point at the first element of the 'channels' flex array. So this is fine.  However when doing:   mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].bitrates = 			(void *)((u8 *)mvm->nvm_data->channels + 1); because of the (u8 *) cast we add only 1 to the address of the beginning of the flex array.

CVE-2024-3848,A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.11.0 identified as a bypass for the previously addressed CVE-2023-6909. The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that when processed ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result an attacker can read arbitrary files including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal.,7.5,CWE-29
CVE-2025-21654,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ovl: support encoding fid from inode with no alias  Dmitry Safonov reported that a WARN_ON() assertion can be trigered by userspace when calling inotify_show_fdinfo() for an overlayfs watched inode whose dentry aliases were discarded with drop_caches.  The WARN_ON() assertion in inotify_show_fdinfo() was removed because it is possible for encoding file handle to fail for other reason but the impact of failing to encode an overlayfs file handle goes beyond this assertion.  As shown in the LTP test case mentioned in the link below failure to encode an overlayfs file handle from a non-aliased inode also leads to failure to report an fid with FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.  As Dmitry notes in his analyzis of the problem ovl_encode_fh() fails if it cannot find an alias for the inode but this failure can be fixed. ovl_encode_fh() seldom uses the alias and in the case of non-decodable file handles as is often the case with fanotify fid info ovl_encode_fh() never needs to use the alias to encode a file handle.  Defer finding an alias until it is actually needed so ovl_encode_fh() will not fail in the common case of FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.,5.5,CWE-617

CVE-2024-27933,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. In version 1.39.0 use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()` which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource the raw file descriptor is closed together.  Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.  This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed suppressing all prompt outputs.  Version 1.39.1 fixes the bug. ,8.2,CWE-863
