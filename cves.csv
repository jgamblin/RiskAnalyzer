CVE-2022-24735,Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same or different script at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0 these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable if Lua scripting is not being used is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.,3.9,CWE-94

CVE-2022-48707,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder  Not all decoders have a reset callback.  The CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port to have no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes there are none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoder instance without a commit/reset callback.  Prior to this patch the ->reset() callback was called unconditionally when calling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge 1 Root Port and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL type 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null pointer dereference.  Before the fix a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region and a pass through decoder is reset.  The issue can be reproduced as below     1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a     single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.     2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-28859,Symfony1 is a community fork of symfony 1.4 with DIC form enhancements latest Swiftmailer better performance composer compatible and PHP 8 support. Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However it is possible to include any object type in `$this->_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.0,CWE-502
