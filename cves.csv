A man-in-the-middle attacker can assume a victim's identify for access to government medical and financial resources and can also extract personal data from the card aka the sPACE (Spoofing Password Authenticated Connection Establishment) issue. This occurs because of a combination of factors such as insecure PIN entry (for basic readers) and eid:// deeplinking. The victim must be using a modified eID kernel which may occur if the victim is tricked into installing a fake version of an official app. NOTE: the BSI position is ensuring a secure operational environment at the client side is an obligation of the ID card owner.,9.6,CWE-290
CVE-2024-41808,The OpenObserve open-source observability platform provides the ability to filter logs in a dashboard by the values uploaded in a given log. However all versions of the platform through 0.9.1 do not sanitize user input in the filter selection menu which may result in complete account takeover. It has been noted that the front-end uses `DOMPurify` or Vue templating to escape cross-site scripting (XSS) extensively however certain areas of the front end lack this XSS protection. When combining the missing protection with the insecure authentication handling that the front-end uses a malicious user may be able to take over any victim's account provided they meet the exploitation steps.

CVE-2022-39206,Onedev is an open source self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. When using Docker-based job executors the Docker socket (e.g. /var/run/docker.sock on Linux) is mounted into each Docker step. Users that can define and trigger CI/CD jobs on a project could use this to control the Docker daemon on the host machine. This is a known dangerous pattern as it can be used to break out of Docker containers and in most cases gain root privileges on the host system. This issue allows regular (non-admin) users to potentially take over the build infrastructure of a OneDev instance. Attackers need to have an account (or be able to register one) and need permission to create a project. Since code.onedev.io has the right preconditions for this to be exploited by remote attackers it could have been used to hijack builds of OneDev itself e.g. by injecting malware into the docker images that are built and pushed to Docker Hub. The impact is increased by this as described before. Users are advised to upgrade to 7.3.0 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,9.9,CWE-610

The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25240.,7.8,CWE-120
CVE-2022-30283,In UsbCoreDxe tampering with the contents of the USB working buffer using DMA while certain USB transactions are in process leads to a TOCTOU problem that could be used by an attacker to cause SMRAM corruption and escalation of privileges The UsbCoreDxe module creates a working buffer for USB transactions outside of SMRAM. The code which uses can be inside of SMM making the working buffer untrusted input. The buffer can be corrupted by DMA transfers. The SMM code code attempts to sanitize pointers to ensure all pointers refer to the working buffer but when a pointer is not found in the list of pointers to sanitize the current action is not aborted leading to undefined behavior. This issue was discovered by Insyde engineering based on the general description provided by Intel's iSTARE group.

CVE-2025-21744,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()  On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL pointer dereference occurs.  The following sequence deletes the interface:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_remove_interface()       brcmf_del_if()  Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.  After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is called providing the following sequence:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_proto_detach()       brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()         brcmf_flowring_detach()           brcmf_msgbuf_delete_flowring()             brcmf_msgbuf_remove_flowring()               brcmf_flowring_delete()                 brcmf_get_ifp()                 brcmf_txfinalize()  Since brcmf_get_ip() can and actually will return NULL in this case the call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.  This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.  Although the NULL pointer dereference has only been seen when trying to update the tx statistic all other uses of the ifp pointer have been guarded as well with an early return if ifp is NULL.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-37021,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fpga: manager: add owner module and take its refcount  The current implementation of the fpga manager assumes that the low-level module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the manager if the parent device does not have a driver.  To address this problem add a module owner pointer to the fpga_manager struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for registering the manager to take an additional owner module parameter and rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper macros that automatically set the module that registers the manager as the owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and reduces the chances of registering a manager without setting the owner.  Also update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface for registering an fpga manager.  Other changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_mgr_get() to fpga_mgr_get() and of_fpga_mgr_get() to improve code clarity since the manager device is taken in these functions.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-21697,Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy web services. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled is affected.
