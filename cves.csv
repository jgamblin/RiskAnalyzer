CVE-2025-62709,ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. In ClipBucket version 5.5.2 a change to network.class.php causes the application to dynamically build the server URL from the incoming HTTP Host header when the configuration base_url is not set.

CVE-2025-38053,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: fix null-ptr-deref in idpf_features_check  idpf_features_check is used to validate the TX packet. skb header length is compared with the hardware supported value received from the device control plane. The value is stored in the adapter structure and to access it vport pointer is used. During reset all the vports are released and the vport pointer that the netdev private structure points to is NULL.  To avoid null-ptr-deref store the max header length value in netdev private structure. This also helps to cache the value and avoid accessing adapter pointer in hot path.

CVE-2024-38606,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FW  The function adf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL) feature on a QAT device by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message to the firmware. This triggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMA buffer in memory and returns an array containing the number of accelerators of each type (slices) supported by this HW. The pointer to this array is stored in the adf_tl_hw_data data structure called slice_cnt.  The array slice_cnt is then used in the function tl_print_dev_data() to report in debugfs only statistics about the supported accelerators. An incorrect value of the elements in slice_cnt might lead to an out of bounds memory read. At the moment there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrong value but for robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2024-51989,Password Pusher is an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the PasswordPusher application affecting versions `v1.41.1` through and including `v.1.48.0`.

CVE-2023-22735,Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. In versions of zulip prior to commit `2f6c5a8` but after commit `04cf68b` users could upload files with arbitrary `Content-Type` which would be served from the Zulip hostname with `Content-Disposition: inline` and no `Content-Security-Policy` header allowing them to trick other users into executing arbitrary Javascript in the context of the Zulip application.

CVE-2025-5054,Race condition in Canonical apport up to and including 2.32.0 allows a local attacker to leak sensitive information via PID-reuse by leveraging namespaces.     When handling a crash the function `_check_global_pid_and_forward` which detects if the crashing process resided in a container was being called before `consistency_checks` which attempts to detect if the crashing process had been replaced. Because of this if a process crashed and was quickly replaced with a containerized one apport could be made to forward the core dump to the container potentially leaking sensitive information. `consistency_checks` is now being called before `_check_global_pid_and_forward`. Additionally given that the PID-reuse race condition cannot be reliably detected from userspace alone crashes are only forwarded to containers if the kernel provided a pidfd or if the crashing process was unprivileged (i.e. if dump mode == 1).,4.7,CWE-362
