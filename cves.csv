CVE-2023-52754,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: imon: fix access to invalid resource for the second interface  imon driver probes two USB interfaces and at the probe of the second interface the driver assumes blindly that the first interface got bound with the same imon driver.  It's usually true but it's still possible that the first interface is bound with another driver via a malformed descriptor.  Then it may lead to a memory corruption as spotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata as struct imon_context object although it's a completely different one that was assigned by another driver.  This patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is really bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem above at the probe time.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2025-62379,Reflex is a library to build full-stack web apps in pure Python. In versions 0.5.4 through 0.8.14 the /auth-codespace endpoint automatically assigns the redirect_to query parameter value directly to client-side links without any validation and triggers automatic clicks when the page loads in a GitHub Codespaces environment. This allows attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external URLs. The vulnerable route is only registered when a Codespaces environment is detected and the detection is controlled by environment variables. The same behavior can be activated in production if the GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN environment variable is set. The vulnerability occurs because the code assigns the redirect_to query parameter directly to a.href without any validation and immediately triggers a click (automatic navigation) allowing users to be sent to arbitrary external domains. The execution condition is based on the presence of a sessionStorage flag meaning it triggers immediately on first visits or in incognito/private browsing windows with no server-side origin/scheme whitelist or internal path enforcement defenses in place. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.15. As a workaround users can ensure that GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN is not set in a production environment.,3.1,CWE-601

CVE-2023-52736,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: Do not unset preset when cleaning up codec  Several functions that take part in codec's initialization and removal are re-used by ASoC codec drivers implementations. Drivers mimic the behavior of hda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c with their component->probe/remove() instead.  One of the reasons for that is the expectation of snd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to an instance of struct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once sound card components probing commences.  As ASoC sound card may be unbound without codec device being actually removed from the system unsetting ->preset in snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with module unload -> load scenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned only once during device/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver's module reloading may occur several times throughout the lifetime of an audio stack.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-27789,Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers` and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.,6.2,CWE-1333
