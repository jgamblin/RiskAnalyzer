CVE-2023-30553,Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to multiple SQL injections in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value and the `full_sql` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed to the methods that follow in given SQL engine implementations which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are `execute_check` in `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` `query` method `execute_check` in `sql/engines/goinception.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py` `query` method `execute_check` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which passes unsafe user input into the `object_name_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py` which in turn is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method.

CVE-2024-55553,In FRRouting (FRR) before 10.3 from 6.0 onward all routes are re-validated if the total size of an update received via RTR exceeds the internal socket's buffer size default 4K on most OSes. An attacker can use this to trigger re-parsing of the RIB for FRR routers using RTR by causing more than this number of updates during an update interval (usually 30 minutes). Additionally this effect regularly occurs organically. Furthermore an attacker can use this to trigger route validation continuously. Given that routers with large full tables may need more than 30 minutes to fully re-validate the table continuous issuance/withdrawal of large numbers of ROA may be used to impact the route handling performance of all FRR instances using RPKI globally. Additionally the re-validation will cause heightened BMP traffic to ingestors. Fixed Versions: 10.0.3 10.1.2 10.2.1 >= 10.3.,7.5,CWE-404

CVE-2024-39461,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: bcm: rpi: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws  Commit f316cdff8d67 (clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by) annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data' with __counted_by which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in raspberrypi_discover_clocks() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has been accessed:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c:374:4   index 3 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)' (aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')  Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws which clears up the warning.,5.5,CWE-129

CVE-2022-34770,Tabit - sensitive information disclosure. Several APIs on the web system display without authorization sensitive information such as health statements previous bills in a specific restaurant alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API’s has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However they each receive a ‘tiny URL’ in Tabit’s domain in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.,4.6,CWE-639

CVE-2021-47506,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race  A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation it will be freed as soon as the callback is done with it without ever being removed from del_recall_lru.  Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings usually in the laundromat thread.  I suspect aba2072f4523 nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding writes made this bug easier to hit but I looked as far back as v3.0 and it looks to me it already had the same problem.
