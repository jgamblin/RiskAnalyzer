CVE-2023-47628,DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. DataHub Frontend's sessions are configured using Play Framework's default settings for stateless session which do not set an expiration time for a cookie. Due to this if a session cookie were ever leaked it would be valid forever. DataHub uses a stateless session cookie that is not invalidated on logout it is just removed from the browser forcing the user to login again. However if an attacker extracted a cookie from an authenticated user it would continue to be valid as there is no validation on a time window the session token is valid for due to a combination of the usage of LegacyCookiesModule from Play Framework and using default settings which do not set an expiration time. All DataHub instances prior to the patch that have removed the datahub user but not the default policies applying to that user are affected. Users are advised to update to version 0.12.1 which addresses the issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.2,CWE-613

CVE-2025-22150,Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client. Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to versions 5.28.5 6.21.1 and 7.2.3 undici uses `Math.random()` to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the output of `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its generated values are known. If there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests to an attacker-controlled website they can use this to leak the necessary values. Therefore an attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are met. This is fixed in versions 5.28.5 6.21.1 and 7.2.3. As a workaround do not issue multipart requests to attacker controlled servers.,6.8,CWE-330

CVE-2022-39199,immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. immudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish between different server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep the state for multiple servers. SDK does not validate this uuid and can accept any value reported by the server. A malicious server can change the reported UUID tricking the client to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state completely irrelevant to the one previously retrieved from the server. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1. As a workaround when initializing an immudb client object a custom state handler can be used to store the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores the server UUID can be used to ensure that even if the server changes the UUID client will still consider it to be the same server.,5.8,CWE-345

CVE-2023-46252,Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. Affected versions are missing origin verification in a postMessage handler which introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The editor-sdk.js file defines three different class-like functions which employ a global message event listener: SquidexSidebar SquidexWidget and SquidexFormField.

CVE-2022-49085,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drbd: Fix five use after free bugs in get_initial_state  In get_initial_state it calls notify_initial_state_done(skb..) if cb->args[5]==1. If genlmsg_put() failed in notify_initial_state_done() the skb will be freed by nlmsg_free(skb). Then get_initial_state will goto out and the freed skb will be used by return value skb->len which is a uaf bug.

My patch lets the problem callee functions: notify_initial_state_done and notify_*_state_change return an error code if errors happen. So that the error codes could be propagated and the uaf bugs can be avoid.  v2 reports a compilation warning.
