CVE-2022-39242,Frontier is an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate. Prior to commit d3beddc6911a559a3ecc9b3f08e153dbe37a8658 the worst case weight was always accounted as the block weight for all cases.

CVE-2024-26999,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial/pmac_zilog: Remove flawed mitigation for rx irq flood  The mitigation was intended to stop the irq completely. That may be better than a hard lock-up but it turns out that you get a crash anyway if you're using pmac_zilog as a serial console:  ttyPZ0: pmz: rx irq flood ! BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0 swapper/0  That's because the pr_err() call in pmz_receive_chars() results in pmz_console_write() attempting to lock a spinlock already locked in pmz_interrupt(). With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y this produces a fatal BUG splat. The spinlock in question is the one in struct uart_port.  Even when it's not fatal the serial port rx function ceases to work. Also the iteration limit doesn't play nicely with QEMU as can be seen in the bug report linked below.  A web search for other reports of the error message pmz: rx irq flood didn't produce anything. So I don't think this code is needed any more. Remove it.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2022-48713,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix crash with stop filters in single-range mode  Add a check for !buf->single before calling pt_buffer_region_size in a place where a missing check can cause a kernel crash.  Fixes a bug introduced by commit 670638477aed (perf/x86/intel/pt: Opportunistically use single range output mode) which added a support for PT single-range output mode. Since that commit if a PT stop filter range is hit while tracing the kernel will crash because of a null pointer dereference in pt_handle_status due to calling pt_buffer_region_size without a ToPA configured.  The commit which introduced single-range mode guarded almost all uses of the ToPA buffer variables with checks of the buf->single variable but missed the case where tracing was stopped by the PT hardware which happens when execution hits a configured stop filter.  Tested that hitting a stop filter while PT recording successfully records a trace with this patch but crashes without this patch.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-36025,Besu is a Java-based Ethereum client. In versions newer than 22.1.3 and prior to 22.7.1 Besu is subject to an Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types. An error in 32 bit signed and unsigned types in the calculation of available gas in the CALL operations (including DELEGATECALL) results in incorrect gas being passed into called contracts and incorrect gas being returned after call execution. Where the amount of gas makes a difference in the success or failure or if the gas is a negative 64 bit value the execution will result in a different state root than expected resulting in a consensus failure in networks with multiple EVM implementations. In networks with a single EVM implementation this can be used to execute with significantly more gas than then transaction requested possibly exceeding gas limitations.

CVE-2023-34281,D-Link DIR-2150 GetFirmwareStatus Target Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-2150 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the SOAP API interface which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20561.,8.0,CWE-78
CVE-2025-53098,Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. The project-specific MCP configuration for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace. Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands prior to version 3.20.3 it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project this would have led to arbitrary command execution. This issue is of moderate severity since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack) for the user to have MCP enabled (on by default) and for the user to have enabled auto-approved file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files including all files within the `.roo/` folder.,8.1,CWE-77

This feature allows the user to enter in their comment in markdown comment allowing them to use common markdown features such as `**` for bolded text. However the markdown text is currently not sanitized before rendering allowing an attacker to enter a malicious payload for the comment which leads to XSS. This puts existing applications that use ZenUML unsandboxed at risk of arbitrary JavaScript execution when rendering user-controlled diagrams. This vulnerability was patched in version 3.23.25,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2023-31098,Weak Password Requirements vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache InLong.This issue affects Apache InLong: from 1.1.0 through 1.6.0.   When users change their password to a simple password (with any character or symbol) attackers can easily guess the user's password and access the account.  Users are advised to upgrade to Apache InLong's 1.7.0 or cherry-pick  https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/7805 https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/7805  to solve it.   ,9.8,CWE-521
CVE-2025-57800,Audiobookshelf is an open-source self-hosted audiobook server. In versions 2.6.0 through 2.26.3 the application does not properly restrict redirect callback URLs during OIDC authentication. An attacker can craft a login link that causes Audiobookshelf to store an arbitrary callback in a cookie which is later used to redirect the user after authentication. The server then issues a 302 redirect to the attacker-controlled URL appending sensitive OIDC tokens as query parameters. This allows an attacker to obtain the victim's tokens and perform full account takeover including creating persistent admin users if the victim is an administrator. Tokens are further leaked via browser history Referer headers and server logs. This vulnerability impacts all Audiobookshelf deployments using OIDC; no IdP misconfiguration is required. The issue is fixed in version 2.28.0. No known workarounds exist.,8.8,CWE-523
CVE-2025-7496,The WPC Smart Compare for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via DOM elements in all versions up to and including 6.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

CVE-2024-37141,Dell PowerProtect DD versions prior to 8.0 LTS 7.13.1.0 LTS 7.10.1.30 LTS 7.7.5.40 contain an open redirect vulnerability. A remote low privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to information disclosure.,3.5,CWE-601
CVE-2023-40587,Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names we would strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly Python 3.11 and 3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00` found returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not affected downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.,4.3,CWE-22
