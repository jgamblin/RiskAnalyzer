CVE-2024-55603,Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`) to store the session data in a database. Therefore when a `session_id` is given kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point it does not correctly verify if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus a session which's lifetime is already `> time()` is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function that does remove invalid sessions is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()` based on `session.gc_divisor` `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1 session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-613

CVE-2025-47781,Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Versions up to and including 3.22.1 of the application features token based authentication. When a user attempts to login to the application they insert their email and a 6 digit code is sent to their email address to complete the authentication. A token that consists of 6 digits only presents weak entropy however and when coupled with no token brute force protection makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of a valid email address to successfully brute force the token within 15 minutes (token expiration time) and take over the account associated with the targeted email address. All users on the Rallly applications are impacted. As long as an attacker knows the user's email address they used to register on the app they can systematically take over any user account. For the authentication mechanism to be safe the token would need to be assigned a complex high entropy value that cannot be bruteforced within reasonable time and ideally rate limiting the /api/auth/callback/email endpoint to further make brute force attempts unreasonable within the 15 minutes time. As of time of publication no patched versions are available.,9.8,CWE-331

CVE-2022-23538,github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client is the Go client for the Singularity Container Services (SCS) Container Library Service. When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image with authentication the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow with redirect to S3 is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io) does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation using a 3rd party S3 storage service are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.,5.2,CWE-522

CVE-2022-49376,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: sd: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference  If sd_probe() sees an early error before sdkp->device is initialized sd_zbc_release_disk() is called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when sd_is_zoned() is called inside that function. Avoid this by removing the call to sd_zbc_release_disk() in sd_probe() error path.  This change is safe and does not result in zone information memory leakage because the zone information for a zoned disk is allocated only when sd_revalidate_disk() is called at which point sdkp->disk_dev is fully set resulting in sd_disk_release() being called when needed to cleanup a disk zone information using sd_zbc_release_disk().,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-43631, On boot the Pillar eve container checks for the existence and content of “/config/authorized_keys”.  If the file is present and contains a supported public key the container will go on to open port 22 and enable sshd with the given keys as the authorized keys for root login.  An attacker could easily add their own keys and gain full control over the system without triggering the “measured boot” mechanism implemented by EVE OS and without marking the device as “UUD” (“Unknown Update Detected”).  This is because the “/config” partition is not protected by “measured boot” it is mutable and it is not encrypted in any way.     An attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values thus not triggering the “measured boot” mechanism and having full access to the vault.    Note:  This issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure to Zededa) where the config partition measurement was added to PCR13:  • aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141  • 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.

CVE-2023-46232,era-compiler-vyper is the EraVM Vyper compiler for zkSync Era a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum. Prior to era-compiler-vype version 1.3.10 a bug prevented the initialization of the first immutable variable for Vyper contracts meeting certain criteria. The problem arises when there is a String or Array with more 256-bit words allocated than initialized. It results in the second word’s index unset that is effectively set to 0 so the first immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the ImmutableSimulator. Version 1.3.10 fixes this issue by setting all indexes in advance. The problem will go away but it will get more expensive if the user allocates a lot of uninitialized space e.g. `String[4096]`. Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way of working around the issue. ,5.3,CWE-471

CVE-2025-20215,A vulnerability in the meeting-join functionality of Cisco Webex Meetings could have allowed an unauthenticated network-proximate attacker to complete a meeting-join process in place of an intended targeted user provided the requisite conditions were satisfied. Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service and no customer action is needed.    This vulnerability existed due to client certificate validation issues. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by monitoring local wireless or adjacent networks for client-join requests and attempting to interrupt and complete the meeting-join flow as another user who was currently joining a meeting. To successfully exploit the vulnerability an attacker would need the capability to position themselves in a local wireless or adjacent network to monitor and intercept the targeted network traffic flows and to satisfy timing requirements in order to interrupt the meeting-join flow and exploit the vulnerability. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to join the meeting as another user.

CVE-2023-31127,libspdm is a sample implementation that follows the DMTF SPDM specifications. A vulnerability has been identified in SPDM session establishment in libspdm prior to version 2.3.1. If a device supports both DHE session and PSK session with mutual authentication the attacker may be able to establish the session with `KEY_EXCHANGE` and `PSK_FINISH` to bypass the mutual authentication. This is most likely to happen when the Requester begins a session using one method (DHE for example) and then uses the other method's finish (PSK_FINISH in this example) to establish the session. The session hashes would be expected to fail in this case but the condition was not detected.  This issue only impacts the SPDM responder which supports `KEY_EX_CAP=1 and `PSK_CAP=10b` at same time with mutual authentication requirement. The SPDM requester is not impacted. The SPDM responder is not impacted if `KEY_EX_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=01b`. The SPDM responder is not impacted if mutual authentication is not required.  libspdm 1.0 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 are all impacted. Older branches are not maintained but users of the 2.3 branch may receive a patch in version 2.3.2. The SPDM specification (DSP0274) does not contain this vulnerability.,9.0,CWE-287

CVE-2025-46719,Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Prior to version 0.6.6 a vulnerability in the way certain html tags in chat messages are rendered allows attackers to inject JavaScript code into a chat transcript. The JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser every time that chat transcript is opened allowing attackers to retrieve the user's access token and gain full control over their account. Chat transcripts can be shared with other users in the same server or with the whole open-webui community if Enable Community Sharing is enabled in the admin panel. If this exploit is used against an admin user it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution on the server where the open-webui backend is hosted. This can be done by creating a new function which contains malicious python code. This vulnerability also affects chat transcripts uploaded to `https://openwebui.com/c/<user>/<chat_id>` allowing for wormable stored XSS in https[:]//openwebui[.]com. Version 0.6.6 contains a patch for the issue.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2021-47214,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hugetlb userfaultfd: fix reservation restore on userfaultfd error  Currently in the is_continue case in hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte() if we bail out using goto out_release_unlock; in the cases where idx >= size or !huge_pte_none() the code will detect that new_pagecache_page == false and so call restore_reserve_on_error().  In this case I see restore_reserve_on_error() delete the reservation and the following call to remove_inode_hugepages() will increment h->resv_hugepages causing a 100% reproducible leak.  We should treat the is_continue case similar to adding a page into the pagecache and set new_pagecache_page to true to indicate that there is no reservation to restore on the error path and we need not call restore_reserve_on_error().  Rename new_pagecache_page to page_in_pagecache to make that clear.,5.5,CWE-401
