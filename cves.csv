CVE-2022-49535,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference after failing to issue FLOGI and PLOGI  If lpfc_issue_els_flogi() fails and returns non-zero status the node reference count is decremented to trigger the release of the nodelist structure. However if there is a prior registration or dev-loss-evt work pending the node may be released prematurely.  When dev-loss-evt completes the released node is referenced causing a use-after-free null pointer dereference.  Similarly when processing non-zero ELS PLOGI completion status in lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi() the ndlp flags are checked for a transport registration before triggering node removal.  If dev-loss-evt work is pending the node may be released prematurely and a subsequent call to lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_handler() results in a use after free ndlp dereference.  Add test for pending dev-loss before decrementing the node reference count for FLOGI PLOGI PRLI and ADISC handling.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-4039,**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains  that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer  overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application  without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.  The default behavior when the stack-protector  detects an overflow is to terminate your application resulting in  controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer  overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change  program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to  go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.,4.8,CWE-693

CVE-2023-52519,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Disable and reenable ACPI GPE bit  The EHL (Elkhart Lake) based platforms provide a OOB (Out of band) service which allows to wakup device when the system is in S5 (Soft-Off state). This OOB service can be enabled/disabled from BIOS settings. When enabled the ISH device gets PME wake capability. To enable PME wakeup driver also needs to enable ACPI GPE bit.  On resume BIOS will clear the wakeup bit. So driver need to re-enable it in resume function to keep the next wakeup capability.

CVE-2021-47026,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/rtrs-clt: destroy sysfs after removing session from active list  A session can be removed dynamically by sysfs interface remove_path that eventually calls rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs function.  The current rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs first removes the sysfs interfaces and frees sess->stats object. Second it removes the session from the active list.  Therefore some functions could access non-connected session and access the freed sess->stats object even-if they check the session status before accessing the session.  For instance rtrs_clt_request and get_next_path_min_inflight check the session status and try to send IO to the session.  The session status could be changed when they are trying to send IO but they could not catch the change and update the statistics information in sess->stats object and generate use-after-free problem. (see: RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading its stats)  This patch changes the rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs to remove the session from the active session list and then destroy the sysfs interfaces.  Each function still should check the session status because closing or error recovery paths can change the status.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-29020,@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: ['passport' 'session'])` to clear all the session attributes by default preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.,6.5,CWE-352

CVE-2022-24884,ecdsautils is a tiny collection of programs used for ECDSA (keygen sign verify). `ecdsa_verify_[prepare_]legacy()` does not check whether the signature values `r` and `s` are non-zero. A signature consisting only of zeroes is always considered valid making it trivial to forge signatures. Requiring multiple signatures from different public keys does not mitigate the issue: `ecdsa_verify_list_legacy()` will accept an arbitrary number of such forged signatures. Both the `ecdsautil verify` CLI command and the libecdsautil library are affected. The issue has been fixed in ecdsautils 0.4.1. All older versions of ecdsautils (including versions before the split into a library and a CLI utility) are vulnerable.,10.0,CWE-347
