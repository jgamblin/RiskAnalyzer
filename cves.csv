CVE-2023-28102,discordrb is an implementation of the Discord API using Ruby. In discordrb before commit `91e13043ffa` the `encoder.rb` file unsafely constructs a shell string using the file parameter which can potentially leave clients of discordrb vulnerable to command injection. The library is not directly exploitable: the exploit requires that some client of the library calls the vulnerable method with user input. However if unsafe input reaches the library method then an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine. Full impact will depend on the permissions of the process running the `discordrb` library and will likely not be total system access. This issue has been addressed in code but a new release of the `discordrb` gem has not been uploaded to rubygems. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2022-094`.,8.3,CWE-78

CVE-2024-50335,SuiteCRM is an open-source enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. The Publish Key field in SuiteCRM's Edit Profile page is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This can be exploited to steal CSRF tokens and perform unauthorized actions such as creating new administrative users without proper authentication. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the Publish Key field within the SuiteCRM application. When an attacker injects a malicious script it gets executed within the context of an authenticated user's session. The injected script (o.js) then leverages the captured CSRF token to forge requests that create new administrative users effectively compromising the integrity and security of the CRM instance. This issue has been addressed in versions 7.14.6 and 8.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.9,CWE-79

CVE-2024-56759,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled  When a COWing a tree block at btrfs_cow_block() and we have the tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y) we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent buffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths that call btrfs_cow_block() such as btrfs_search_slot() we are holding the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block() drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls free_extent_buffer_stale(buf) which schedules the release of the extent buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block() and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block() is called resulting in a use-after-free.  Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed. This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag code at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node() since btrfs_force_cow_block() is called there but this is fine and it was actually missing there.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-25124,Fiber is a web framework written in go. Prior to version 2.52.1 the CORS middleware allows for insecure configurations that could potentially expose the application to multiple CORS-related vulnerabilities. Specifically it allows setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to a wildcard (`*`) while also having the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true which goes against recommended security best practices.

CVE-2024-2746,Incomplete fix for CVE-2024-1929  The problem with CVE-2024-1929 was that the dnf5 D-Bus daemon accepted arbitrary configuration parameters from unprivileged users which allowed a local root exploit by tricking the daemon into loading a user controlled plugin. All of this happened before Polkit authentication was even started.  The dnf5 library code does not check whether non-root users control the directory in question.   On one hand this poses a Denial-of-Service attack vector by making the daemonoperate on a blocking file (e.g. named FIFO special file) or a very large file that causes an out-of-memory situation (e.g. /dev/zero). On the other hand this can be used to let the daemon process privileged files like /etc/shadow. The file in question is parsed as an INI file. Error diagnostics resulting from parsing privileged files could cause information leaks if these diagnostics are accessible to unprivileged users. In the case of libdnf5 no such user accessible diagnostics should exist though.  Also a local attacker can place a valid repository configuration file in this directory. This configuration file allows to specify a plethora of additional configuration options. This makes various additional code paths in libdnf5 accessible to the attacker.,8.8,CWE-20

CVE-2022-31127,NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com <a href=http://attacker.com>Before signing in claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com` and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4 as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest` you only need to upgrade. Otherwise make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it.,7.1,CWE-79
CVE-2023-52566,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential use after free in nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data()  In nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data() brelse(bh) is called to drop the reference count of bh when the call to nilfs_dat_translate() fails.  If the reference count hits 0 and its owner page gets unlocked bh may be freed.  However bh->b_page is dereferenced to put the page after that which may result in a use-after-free bug.  This patch moves the release operation after unlocking and putting the page.  NOTE: The function in question is only called in GC and in combination with current userland tools address translation using DAT does not occur in that function so the code path that causes this issue will not be executed.  However it is possible to run that code path by intentionally modifying the userland GC library or by calling the GC ioctl directly.

CVE-2025-0677,A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup the grub's UFS module checks the inode's data size to allocate the internal buffer to read the file content however it fails to check if the symlink data size has overflown. When this occurs grub_malloc() may be called with a smaller value than needed. When further reading the data from the disk into the buffer the grub_ufs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the end of the allocated size. An attack can leverage this by crafting a malicious filesystem and as a result it will corrupt data stored in the heap allowing for arbitrary code execution used to by-pass secure boot mechanisms.,6.4,CWE-787

CVE-2024-45818,The hypervisor contains code to accelerate VGA memory accesses for HVM guests when the (virtual) VGA is in standard mode.  Locking involved there has an unusual discipline leaving a lock acquired past the return from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a problem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses both of which touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't relevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access the lock that is already being held would be attempted to be re-acquired resulting in a deadlock.  This deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced but was analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light of the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking discipline work.  In staging this logic has all been removed because it was discovered to be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore we are fixing the locking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note that even with the feature disabled the lock would still be acquired for any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.,6.5,CWE-667
CVE-2024-32963,Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer.

CVE-2024-44969,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/sclp: Prevent release of buffer in I/O  When a task waiting for completion of a Store Data operation is interrupted an attempt is made to halt this operation. If this attempt fails due to a hardware or firmware problem there is a chance that the SCLP facility might store data into buffers referenced by the original operation at a later time.  Handle this situation by not releasing the referenced data buffers if the halt attempt fails. For current use cases this might result in a leak of few pages of memory in case of a rare hardware/firmware malfunction.,5.5,CWE-401
CVE-2024-53113,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: fix NULL pointer dereference in alloc_pages_bulk_noprof  We triggered a NULL pointer dereference for ac.preferred_zoneref->zone in alloc_pages_bulk_noprof() when the task is migrated between cpusets.  When cpuset is enabled in prepare_alloc_pages() ac->nodemask may be &current->mems_allowed.  when first_zones_zonelist() is called to find preferred_zoneref the ac->nodemask may be modified concurrently if the task is migrated between different cpusets.  Assuming we have 2 NUMA Node when traversing Node1 in ac->zonelist the nodemask is 2 and when traversing Node2 in ac->zonelist the nodemask is 1.  As a result the ac->preferred_zoneref points to NULL zone.  In alloc_pages_bulk_noprof() for_each_zone_zonelist_nodemask() finds a allowable zone and calls zonelist_node_idx(ac.preferred_zoneref) leading to NULL pointer dereference.  __alloc_pages_noprof() fixes this issue by checking NULL pointer in commit ea57485af8f4 (mm page_alloc: fix check for NULL preferred_zone) and commit df76cee6bbeb (mm page_alloc: remove redundant checks from alloc fastpath).  To fix it check NULL pointer for preferred_zoneref->zone.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-41332,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. In Cilium clusters where Cilium's Layer 7 proxy has been disabled creating workloads with `policy.cilium.io/proxy-visibility` annotations (in Cilium >= v1.13) or `io.cilium.proxy-visibility` annotations (in Cilium <= v1.12) causes the Cilium agent to segfault on the node to which the workload is assigned. Existing traffic on the affected node will continue to flow but the Cilium agent on the node will not able to process changes to workloads running on the node. This will also prevent workloads from being able to start on the affected node. The denial of service will be limited to the node on which the workload is scheduled however an attacker may be able to schedule workloads on the node of their choosing which could lead to targeted attacks. This issue has been resolved in Cilium versions 1.14.2 1.13.7 and 1.12.14. Users unable to upgrade can avoid this denial of service attack by enabling the Layer 7 proxy.  ,3.5,CWE-755
