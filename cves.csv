CVE-2022-23583,Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that any binary op would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the op. In that case calling the templated binary operator for the binary op would receive corrupted data due to the type confusion involved. If `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly. In most cases this would be a silent failure but we have noticed scenarios where this results in a `CHECK` crash hence a denial of service. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1 TensorFlow 2.6.3 and TensorFlow 2.5.3 as these are also affected and still in supported range.,6.5,CWE-617

CVE-2022-39394,Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2 there is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition of the `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This discrepancy causes the function implementation to perform a 4-byte write into a 1-byte buffer provided by the caller. This can lead to three zero bytes being written beyond the 1-byte location provided by the caller. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by providing a 4-byte buffer casted to a 1-byte buffer when calling `wasmtime_trap_code`. Users of the `wasmtime` crate are not affected by this issue only users of the C API function `wasmtime_trap_code` are affected.,3.8,CWE-787

CVE-2023-47628,DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. DataHub Frontend's sessions are configured using Play Framework's default settings for stateless session which do not set an expiration time for a cookie. Due to this if a session cookie were ever leaked it would be valid forever. DataHub uses a stateless session cookie that is not invalidated on logout it is just removed from the browser forcing the user to login again. However if an attacker extracted a cookie from an authenticated user it would continue to be valid as there is no validation on a time window the session token is valid for due to a combination of the usage of LegacyCookiesModule from Play Framework and using default settings which do not set an expiration time. All DataHub instances prior to the patch that have removed the datahub user but not the default policies applying to that user are affected.

CVE-2022-2053,When a POST request comes through AJP and the request exceeds the max-post-size limit (maxEntitySize) Undertow's AjpServerRequestConduit implementation closes a connection without sending any response to the client/proxy. This behavior results in that a front-end proxy marking the backend worker (application server) as an error state and not forward requests to the worker for a while. In mod_cluster this continues until the next STATUS request (10 seconds intervals) from the application server updates the server state. So in the worst case it can result in All workers are in error state and mod_cluster responds 503 Service Unavailable for a while (up to 10 seconds). In mod_proxy_balancer it does not forward requests to the worker until the retry timeout passes. However luckily mod_proxy_balancer has forcerecovery setting (On by default; this parameter can force the immediate recovery of all workers without considering the retry parameter of the workers if all workers of a balancer are in error state.). So unlike mod_cluster mod_proxy_balancer does not result in responding 503 Service Unavailable. An attacker could use this behavior to send a malicious request and trigger server errors resulting in DoS (denial of service). This flaw was fixed in Undertow 2.2.19.Final Undertow 2.3.0.Alpha2.,7.5,CWE-400
