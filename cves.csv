CVE-2024-43863,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling  Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove the fence from the pending list and thus doesn't require a lock to fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.  vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all fences and update their status to do that it holds a lock to prevent the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending fences for which it holds a lock.  dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll calls the wait which signals the fences which are being destroyed. The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it was called.  Old bug but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling interfaces. Fix those in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-24816,IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.,4.5,CWE-20

CVE-2022-50255,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix reading strings from synthetic events  The follow commands caused a crash:    # cd /sys/kernel/tracing   # echo 's:open char file[]' > dynamic_events   # echo 'hist:keys=common_pid:file=filename:onchange($file).trace(open$file)' > events/syscalls/sys_enter_openat/trigger'   # echo 1 > events/synthetic/open/enable  BOOM!  The problem is that the synthetic event field char file[] will read the value given to it as a string without any memory checks to make sure the address is valid. The above example will pass in the user space address and the sythetic event code will happily call strlen() on it and then strscpy() where either one will cause an oops when accessing user space addresses.  Use the helper functions from trace_kprobe and trace_eprobe that can read strings safely (and actually succeed when the address is from user space and the memory is mapped in).  Now the above can show:       packagekitd-1721    [000] ...2.   104.597170: open: file=/usr/lib/rpm/fileattrs/cmake.attr     in:imjournal-978     [006] ...2.   104.599642: open: file=/var/lib/rsyslog/imjournal.state.tmp      packagekitd-1721    [000] ...2.   104.626308: open: file=/usr/lib/rpm/fileattrs/debuginfo.attr,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2025-59340,jinjava is a Java-based template engine based on django template syntax adapted to render jinja templates. Priori to 2.8.1 by using mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical() it is possible to instruct the underlying ObjectMapper to deserialize attacker-controlled input into arbitrary classes. This enables the creation of semi-arbitrary class instances without directly invoking restricted methods or class literals. As a result an attacker can escape the sandbox and instantiate classes such as java.net.URL opening up the ability to access local files and URLs(e.g. file:///etc/passwd). With further chaining this primitive can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.8.1.,9.8,CWE-1336

CVE-2023-52498,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code  It is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core code deadlocks because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a requisite supplier device's one for example).  Address this by changing the code in question to use async_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly run them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-58042,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rhashtable: Fix potential deadlock by moving schedule_work outside lock  Move the hash table growth check and work scheduling outside the rht lock to prevent a possible circular locking dependency.  The original implementation could trigger a lockdep warning due to a potential deadlock scenario involving nested locks between rhashtable bucket rq lock and dsq lock. By relocating the growth check and work scheduling after releasing the rth lock we break this potential deadlock chain.  This change expands the flexibility of rhashtable by removing restrictive locking that previously limited its use in scheduler and workqueue contexts.  Import to say that this calls rht_grow_above_75() which reads from struct rhashtable without holding the lock if this is a problem we can move the check to the lock and schedule the workqueue after the lock.   Modified so that atomic_inc is also moved outside of the bucket lock along with the growth above 75% check.,5.5,CWE-667
