CVE-2025-14931,Hugging Face smolagents Remote Python Executor Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Hugging Face smolagents. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of pickle data. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-28312.,10.0,CWE-502
CVE-2023-0240,There is a logic error in io_uring's implementation which can be used to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability leading to privilege escalation.  In the io_prep_async_work function the assumption that the last io_grab_identity call cannot return false is not true and in this case the function will use the init_cred or the previous linked requests identity to do operations instead of using the current identity. This can lead to reference counting issues causing use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past version 5.10.161.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-50731,MindsDB is a SQL Server for artificial intelligence. Prior to version 23.11.4.1 the `put` method in `mindsdb/mindsdb/api/http/namespaces/file.py` does not validate the user-controlled name value which is used in a temporary file name which is afterwards opened for writing on lines 122-125 which leads to path injection. Later in the method the temporary directory is deleted on line 151 but since we can write outside of the directory using the path injection vulnerability the potentially dangerous file is not deleted. Arbitrary file contents can be written due to `f.write(chunk)` on line 125. Mindsdb does check later on line 149 in the `save_file` method in `file-controller.py` which calls the `_handle_source` method in `file_handler.py` if a file is of one of the types `csv` `json` `parquet` `xls` or `xlsx`. However since the check happens after the file has already been written the files will still exist (and will not be removed due to the path injection described earlier) just the `_handle_source` method will return an error. The same user-controlled source source is used also in another path injection sink on line 138. This leads to another path injection which allows an attacker to delete any `zip` or `tar.gz` files on the server.,9.1,CWE-918
CVE-2023-53359,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()  When calling debugfs_lookup() the result must have dput() called on it otherwise the memory will leak over time.

CVE-2024-2548,A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui application specifically within the `lollms_core/lollms/server/endpoints/lollms_binding_files_server.py` and `lollms_core/lollms/security.py` files. Due to inadequate validation of file paths between Windows and Linux environments using `Path(path).is_absolute()` attackers can exploit this flaw to read any file on the system. This issue affects the latest version of LoLLMs running on the Windows platform. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker sends a specially crafted request to the `/user_infos/{path:path}` endpoint allowing the reading of arbitrary files as demonstrated with the `win.ini` file. The issue has been addressed in version 9.5 of the software.,7.5,CWE-36

CVE-2023-37460,Plexis Archiver is a collection of Plexus components to create archives or extract archives to a directory with a unified `Archiver`/`UnArchiver` API. Prior to version 4.8.0 using AbstractUnArchiver for extracting an archive might lead to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. When extracting an archive with an entry that already exists in the destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist - the `resolveFile()` function will return the symlink's source instead of its target which will pass the verification that ensures the file will not be extracted outside of the destination directory. Later `Files.newOutputStream()` that follows symlinks by default  will actually write the entry's content to the symlink's target. Whoever uses plexus archiver to extract an untrusted archive is vulnerable to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. Version 4.8.0 contains a patch for this issue.,8.1,CWE-22

CVE-2022-49535,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference after failing to issue FLOGI and PLOGI  If lpfc_issue_els_flogi() fails and returns non-zero status the node reference count is decremented to trigger the release of the nodelist structure. However if there is a prior registration or dev-loss-evt work pending the node may be released prematurely.  When dev-loss-evt completes the released node is referenced causing a use-after-free null pointer dereference.  Similarly when processing non-zero ELS PLOGI completion status in lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi() the ndlp flags are checked for a transport registration before triggering node removal.  If dev-loss-evt work is pending the node may be released prematurely and a subsequent call to lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_handler() results in a use after free ndlp dereference.  Add test for pending dev-loss before decrementing the node reference count for FLOGI PLOGI PRLI and ADISC handling.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-49669,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: fix race on unaccepted mptcp sockets  When the listener socket owning the relevant request is closed it frees the unaccepted subflows and that causes later deletion of the paired MPTCP sockets.

CVE-2023-22735,Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. In versions of zulip prior to commit `2f6c5a8` but after commit `04cf68b` users could upload files with arbitrary `Content-Type` which would be served from the Zulip hostname with `Content-Disposition: inline` and no `Content-Security-Policy` header allowing them to trick other users into executing arbitrary Javascript in the context of the Zulip application.  Among other things this enables session theft. Only deployments which use the S3 storage (not the local-disk storage) are affected and only deployments which deployed commit 04cf68b45ebb5c03247a0d6453e35ffc175d55da which has only been in `main` not any numbered release. Users affected should upgrade from main again to deploy this fix. Switching from S3 storage to the local-disk storage would nominally mitigate this but is likely more involved than upgrading to the latest `main` which addresses the issue.,4.4,CWE-436

This patch fixes the issue by checking the bearer type before calling tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() in tipc_nl_bearer_add().,5.5,CWE-476
