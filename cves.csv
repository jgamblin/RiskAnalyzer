CVE-2024-49864,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation  In rxrpc_open_socket() it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O thread that will handle it.  This is a problem however as there's a gap between the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv() from the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O thread.  As a quick fix just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's no I/O thread yet.  A better but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such that the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2023-39903,An issue was discovered in Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM) before 2.8.0.061. The ismsnap component (in this specific case at /var/log/fujitsu/ServerViewSuite/ism/FirmwareManagement/FirmwareManagement.log) allows insecure collection and storage of authorization credentials in cleartext. That occurs when users perform any ISM Firmware Repository Address setup test (Test the Connection) or regularly authorize against an already configured remote firmware repository site as set up in ISM Firmware Repository Address. A privileged attacker is therefore able to potentially gather the associated ismsnap maintenance data in the same manner as a trusted party allowed to export ismsnap data from ISM. The preconditions for an ISM installation to be generally vulnerable are that the Download Firmware (Firmware Repository Server) function is enabled and configured and that the character \ (backslash) is used in a user credential (i.e. user/ID or password) of the remote proxy host / firmware repository server.

CVE-2023-25151,opentelemetry-go-contrib is a collection of extensions for OpenTelemetry-Go. The v0.38.0 release of `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` uses the `httpconv.ServerRequest` function to annotate metric measurements for the `http.server.request_content_length` `http.server.response_content_length` and `http.server.duration` instruments. The `ServerRequest` function sets the `http.target` attribute value to be the whole request URI (including the query string)[^1]. The metric instruments do not forget previous measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used this means the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with the unique URIs handled. If the query string is constantly random this will result in a constant increase in memory allocation that can be used in a denial-of-service attack. This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2023-0925,Version 10.11 of webMethods OneData runs an embedded instance of Azul Zulu Java 11.0.15 which hosts a Java RMI registry (listening on TCP port 2099 by default) and two RMI interfaces (listening on a single dynamically assigned TCP high port).    Port 2099 serves as a Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) registry which allows for remotely loading and processing data via RMI interfaces. An unauthenticated attacker with network connectivity to the RMI registry and RMI interface ports can abuse this functionality to instruct the webMethods OneData application to load a malicious serialized Java object as a parameter to one of the available Java methods presented by the RMI interface. Once deserialized on the vulnerable server the malicious code runs as whichever operating system account is used to run the software which in most cases is the local System account on Windows.,9.8,CWE-502

CVE-2022-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()  On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space the ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs even though the CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the file the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to wake waiters as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.  While debugging this I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is OK to do) and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is not fine and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).

CVE-2023-41045,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Graylog makes use of only one single source port for DNS queries. Graylog binds a single socket for outgoing DNS queries and while that socket is bound to a random port number it is never changed again. This goes against recommended practice since 2008 when Dan Kaminsky discovered how easy is to carry out DNS cache poisoning attacks. In order to prevent cache poisoning with spoofed DNS responses it is necessary to maximise the uncertainty in the choice of a source port for a DNS query. Although unlikely in many setups an external attacker could inject forged DNS responses into a Graylog's lookup table cache. In order to prevent this it is at least recommendable to distribute the DNS queries through a pool of distinct sockets each of them with a random source port and renew them periodically. This issue has been addressed in versions 5.0.9 and 5.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,3.7,CWE-345

CVE-2022-49171,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: don't BUG if someone dirty pages without asking ext4 first  [un]pin_user_pages_remote is dirtying pages without properly warning the file system in advance.  A related race was noted by Jan Kara in 2018[1]; however more recently instead of it being a very hard-to-hit race it could be reliably triggered by process_vm_writev(2) which was discovered by Syzbot[2].  This is technically a bug in mm/gup.c but arguably ext4 is fragile in that if some other kernel subsystem dirty pages without properly notifying the file system using page_mkwrite() ext4 will BUG while other file systems will not BUG (although data will still be lost).  So instead of crashing with a BUG issue a warning (since there may be potential data loss) and just mark the page as clean to avoid unprivileged denial of service attacks until the problem can be properly fixed.  More discussion and background can be found in the thread starting at [2].
