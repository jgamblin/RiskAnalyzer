CVE-2024-42316,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()  evict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through page writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass since folio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the isolation.  The second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting scan_control->nr_scanned.  However this can result in underflow of nr_scanned under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment nr_scanned i.e. when folio_trylock() fails.  The underflow can cause the divisor i.e. scale=scanned+reclaimed in vmpressure_calc_level() to become zero resulting in the following crash:    [exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101]   process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b  Since scan_control->nr_scanned has no established semantics the potential double counting has minimal risks.  Therefore fix the problem by not deducting scan_control->nr_scanned in evict_folios().,5.5,CWE-369

CVE-2024-53150,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out of bounds reads when finding clock sources  The current USB-audio driver code doesn't check bLength of each descriptor at traversing for clock descriptors.

CVE-2024-41664,Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network. Prior to `sha-8ea5315` Canarytokens.org was vulnerable to a blind SSRF in the Webhook alert feature. When a Canarytoken is created users choose to receive alerts either via email or via a webhook. If a webhook is supplied when a  Canarytoken is first created the site will make a test request to the supplied URL to ensure it accepts alert notification HTTP requests. No safety checks were performed on the URL leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. The SSRF is Blind because the content of the response is not displayed to the creating user; they are simply told whether an error occurred in making the test request. Using the Blind SSRF it was possible to map out open ports for IPs inside the Canarytokens.org infrastructure. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image or any Docker image after `sha-097d91a`.,5.4,CWE-918

CVE-2024-47660,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsnotify: clear PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily  In some setups directories can have many (usually negative) dentries. Hence __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() function can take a significant amount of time. Since the bulk of this function happens under inode->i_lock this causes a significant contention on the lock when we remove the watch from the directory as the __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() call from fsnotify_recalc_mask() races with __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() calls from __fsnotify_parent() happening on children. This can lead upto softlockup reports reported by users.  Fix the problem by calling fsnotify_update_children_dentry_flags() to set PARENT_WATCHED flags only when parent starts watching children.  When parent stops watching children clear false positive PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily in __fsnotify_parent() for each accessed child.,4.7,CWE-362
CVE-2024-25622,h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The configuration directives provided by the headers handler allows users to modify the response headers being sent by h2o. The configuration file of h2o has scopes and the inner scopes (e.g. path level) are expected to inherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g. global level). However if a header directive is used in the inner scope all the definition in outer scopes are ignored. This can lead to headers not being modified as expected. Depending on the headers being added or removed unexpectedly this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 123f5e2b65dcdba8f7ef659a00d24bd1249141be.,3.1,CWE-670

CVE-2023-39903,An issue was discovered in Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM) before 2.8.0.061. The ismsnap component (in this specific case at /var/log/fujitsu/ServerViewSuite/ism/FirmwareManagement/FirmwareManagement.log) allows insecure collection and storage of authorization credentials in cleartext. That occurs when users perform any ISM Firmware Repository Address setup test (Test the Connection) or regularly authorize against an already configured remote firmware repository site as set up in ISM Firmware Repository Address. A privileged attacker is therefore able to potentially gather the associated ismsnap maintenance data in the same manner as a trusted party allowed to export ismsnap data from ISM. The preconditions for an ISM installation to be generally vulnerable are that the Download Firmware (Firmware Repository Server) function is enabled and configured and that the character \ (backslash) is used in a user credential (i.e. user/ID or password) of the remote proxy host / firmware repository server.

CVE-2021-47482,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: batman-adv: fix error handling  Syzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was in wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().  Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well when there is some kind of indicator which can tell which parts of batadv are initialized; but there isn't any.  All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide ODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work syzbot was able to hit GPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths() because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]  To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one. It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling path 2) It improves the performance since we won't call unneeded batadv_*_free() functions.  So this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory before returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free() and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching uninitialized fields.,5.3,CWE-544

Assuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ /Users/foo/resources ]` When passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine: `(load-resource test.png)` => loads the file /Users/foo/resources/test.png `(load-resource ../resources-alt/test.png)` => rejected outside the load path When passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths: `(load-resource /Users/foo/resources/test.png)` => loads the file /Users/foo/resources/test.png `(load-resource /Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png)` => loads the file /Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png !!! The latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability. This issue’s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `/Users/foo/resources` the actor can cause loading a resource also from `/Users/foo/resources-alt` but not from `/Users/foo/images`. Versions of Venice before and including v1.10.17 are affected by this issue. Upgrade to Venice >= 1.10.18 if you are on a version < 1.10.18. There are currently no known workarounds.,6.1,CWE-22

CVE-2022-31081,HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are most Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer or a comma separated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42 42 42`).

CVE-2024-37155,OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9 the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace carriage return and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.,6.5,CWE-284
