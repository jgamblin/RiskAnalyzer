CVE-2022-36063,Azure RTOS USBx is a USB host device and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all Azure RTOS ThreadX–supported processors. Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.,7.6,CWE-121

CVE-2024-26974,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat - resolve race condition during AER recovery  During the PCI AER system's error recovery process the kernel driver may encounter a race condition with freeing the reset_data structure's memory. If the device restart will take more than 10 seconds the function scheduling that restart will exit due to a timeout and the reset_data structure will be freed. However this data structure is used for completion notification after the restart is completed which leads to a UAF bug.  This results in a KFENCE bug notice.    BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read in adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]   Use-after-free read at 0x00000000bc56fddf (in kfence-#142):   adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]   process_one_work+0x173/0x340  To resolve this race condition the memory associated to the container of the work_struct is freed on the worker if the timeout expired otherwise on the function that schedules the worker.

CVE-2024-42082,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xdp: Remove WARN() from __xdp_reg_mem_model()  syzkaller reports a warning in __xdp_reg_mem_model().  The warning occurs only if __mem_id_init_hash_table() returns an error. It returns the error in two cases:    1. memory allocation fails;   2. rhashtable_init() fails when some fields of rhashtable_params      struct are not initialized properly.  The second case cannot happen since there is a static const rhashtable_params struct with valid fields. So warning is only triggered when there is a problem with memory allocation.  Thus there is no sense in using WARN() to handle this error and it can be safely removed.

CVE-2025-23206,The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. Users who use IAM OIDC custom resource provider package will download CA Thumbprints as part of the custom resource workflow. However the current `tls.connect` method will always set `rejectUnauthorized: false` which is a potential security concern. CDK should follow the best practice and set `rejectUnauthorized: true`. However this could be a breaking change for existing CDK applications and we should fix this with a feature flag. Note that this is marked as low severity Security advisory because the issuer url is provided by CDK users who define the CDK application. If they insist on connecting to a unauthorized OIDC provider CDK should not disallow this. Additionally the code block is run in a Lambda environment which mitigate the MITM attack. The patch is in progress. To mitigate upgrade to CDK v2.177.0 (Expected release date 2025-02-22). Once upgraded users should make sure the feature flag '@aws-cdk/aws-iam:oidcRejectUnauthorizedConnections' is set to true in `cdk.context.json` or `cdk.json`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.1,CWE-347

CVE-2024-40640,vodozemac is an open source implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust.  Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack. The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material. The impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.  Additionally the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper. This has been patched in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272 which has been included in release version 0.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-39864,The CloudStack integration API service allows running its unauthenticated API server (usually on port 8096 when configured and enabled via integration.api.port global setting) for internal portal integrations and for testing purposes. By default the integration API service port is disabled and is considered disabled when integration.api.port is set to 0 or negative. Due to an improper initialisation logic the integration API service would listen on a random port when its port value is set to 0 (default value). An attacker that can access the CloudStack management network could scan and find the randomised integration API service port and exploit it to perform unauthorised administrative actions and perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality integrity and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.  Users are recommended to restrict the network access on the CloudStack management server hosts to only essential ports.

CVE-2022-49501,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usbnet: Run unregister_netdev() before unbind() again  Commit 2c9d6c2b871d (usbnet: run unbind() before unregister_netdev()) sought to fix a use-after-free on disconnect of USB Ethernet adapters.  It turns out that a different fix is necessary to address the issue: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/18b3541e5372bc9b9fc733d422f4e698c089077c.1650177997.git.lukas@wunner.de/  So the commit was not necessary.  The commit made binding and unbinding of USB Ethernet asymmetrical: Before usbnet_probe() first invoked the ->bind() callback and then register_netdev().  usbnet_disconnect() mirrored that by first invoking unregister_netdev() and then ->unbind().  Since the commit the order in usbnet_disconnect() is reversed and no longer mirrors usbnet_probe().  One consequence is that a PHY disconnected (and stopped) in ->unbind() is afterwards stopped once more by unregister_netdev() as it closes the netdev before unregistering.  That necessitates a contortion in ->stop() because the PHY may only be stopped if it hasn't already been disconnected.  Reverting the commit allows making the call to phy_stop() unconditional in ->stop().,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-48790,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme: fix a possible use-after-free in controller reset during load  Unlike .queue_rq in .submit_async_event drivers may not check the ctrl readiness for AER submission. This may lead to a use-after-free condition that was observed with nvme-tcp.  The race condition may happen in the following scenario: 1. driver executes its reset_ctrl_work 2. -> nvme_stop_ctrl - flushes ctrl async_event_work 3. ctrl sends AEN which is received by the host which in turn    schedules AEN handling 4. teardown admin queue (which releases the queue socket) 5. AEN processed submits another AER calling the driver to submit 6. driver attempts to send the cmd ==> use-after-free  In order to fix that add ctrl state check to validate the ctrl is actually able to accept the AER submission.  This addresses the above race in controller resets because the driver during teardown should: 1. change ctrl state to RESETTING 2. flush async_event_work (as well as other async work elements)  So after 12 any other AER command will find the ctrl state to be RESETTING and bail out without submitting the AER.,7.0,CWE-416
