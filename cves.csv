CVE-2023-36480,The Aerospike Java client is a Java application that implements a network protocol to communicate with an Aerospike server. Prior to versions 7.0.0 6.2.0 5.2.0 and 4.5.0 some of the messages received from the server contain Java objects that the client deserializes when it encounters them without further validation. Attackers that manage to trick clients into communicating with a malicious server can include especially crafted objects in its responses that once deserialized by the client force it to execute arbitrary code. This can be abused to take control of the machine the client is running on. Versions 7.0.0 6.2.0 5.2.0 and 4.5.0 contain a patch for this issue.,9.8,CWE-502

CVE-2023-52081,ffcss is a CLI interface to apply and configure Firefox CSS themes. Prior to 0.2.0 the function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. The `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (﹍) which would result in the omitted U+005F (_) for instance. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively while ignoring dashes underscores and dots) so the actual security impact is classified as low. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.2.0. There are no known workarounds.,5.3,CWE-74

CVE-2022-25757,In Apache APISIX before 2.13.0 when decoding JSON with duplicate keys lua-cjson will choose the last occurred value as the result. By passing a JSON with a duplicate key the attacker can bypass the body_schema validation in the request-validation plugin. For example `{string_payload:badstring_payload:good}` can be used to hide the bad input. Systems satisfy three conditions below are affected by this attack: 1. use body_schema validation in the request-validation plugin 2. upstream application uses a special JSON library that chooses the first occurred value like jsoniter or gojay 3. upstream application does not validate the input anymore. The fix in APISIX is to re-encode the validated JSON input back into the request body at the side of APISIX. Improper Input Validation vulnerability in __COMPONENT__ of Apache APISIX allows an attacker to __IMPACT__.

CVE-2024-53063,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access  The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.  The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set or not. When not set dvb_register_device() won't check for boundaries as it will rely that a previous call to dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.  On a similar way dvb_device_open() uses the assumption that the register functions already did the needed checks.  This can be fragile if some device ends using different calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers like Coverity.  So add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.,5.5,CWE-755

CVE-2023-49100,Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) before 2.10 has a potential read out-of-bounds in the SDEI service. The input parameter passed in register x1 is not validated well enough in the function sdei_interrupt_bind. The parameter is passed to a call to plat_ic_get_interrupt_type.

CVE-2024-24823,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id even if for different user credentials. In this case the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an attack is high because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 and any versions of the 6.0 development branch contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists but is relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions` endpoint as that is the only one vulnerable.,5.7,CWE-384

CVE-2024-25618,Mastodon is a free open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured authentication providers (CAS SAML OIDC) to attach to existing local users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave. However some well-known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover OpenID Connect also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6 4.1.14 4.0.14 and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.2,CWE-287
