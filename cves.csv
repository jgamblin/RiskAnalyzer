CVE-2024-26718,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm-crypt dm-verity: disable tasklets  Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock then it calls the tasklet callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may free it tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.  The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt but it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1]. There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory with every tasklet-processed bio.  There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory corruption problem.  But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be backported to the stable kernels. So I'm proposing this commit that disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't remove the tasklet support because the tasklet code will be reused when atomic workqueues will be implemented.

CVE-2024-50145,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()  build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.  __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb allocation fails keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case don't process the packets and don't push them up the network stack - they are skipped.  Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-26898,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts  This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:    A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux   kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on   `struct net_device` and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing   between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`   global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or   potential code execution.  In aoecmd_cfg_pkts() it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into use-after-free because the net_device is freed.  This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in aoecmd_cfg_pkts() and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2021-47406,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: add error checking to ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks()  If the call to ext4_map_blocks() fails due to an corrupted file system ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks() can get stuck in an infinite loop.  This could be reproduced by running generic/526 with a file system that has inline_data and fast_commit enabled.  The system will repeatedly log to the console:  EXT4-fs warning (device dm-3): ext4_block_to_path:105: block 1074800922 > max in inode 131076  and the stack that it gets stuck in is:     ext4_block_to_path+0xe3/0x130    ext4_ind_map_blocks+0x93/0x690    ext4_map_blocks+0x100/0x660    skip_hole+0x47/0x70    ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks+0x223/0x440    ext4_fc_replay_inode+0x29e/0x3b0    ext4_fc_replay+0x278/0x550    do_one_pass+0x646/0xc10    jbd2_journal_recover+0x14a/0x270    jbd2_journal_load+0xc4/0x150    ext4_load_journal+0x1f3/0x490    ext4_fill_super+0x22d4/0x2c00  With this patch generic/526 still fails but system is no longer locking up in a tight loop.  It's likely the root casue is that fast_commit replay is corrupting file systems with inline_data and we probably need to add better error handling in the fast commit replay code path beyond what is done here which essentially just breaks the infinite loop without reporting the to the higher levels of the code.,5.5,CWE-835

CVE-2024-32473,Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine Docker Desktop and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. In 26.0.0 IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses and (3) the interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or in the service configuration of a `compose` file.,4.7,CWE-668

CVE-2023-22464,ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories. Versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.1.30 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that when embedded into an HTML stream would cause the browser to run unwanted code) which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.3 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.30 (if they are using a 1.1.x version).  ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported so users of that release lineage should implement one of the following workarounds. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed path copyfrom paths during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths and wrap them with `[format html]` and `[end]`.  For most users that means that references to `[changes.copy_path]` will become `[format html][changes.copy_path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC else copyfrom path names will be doubly escaped.) ,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2023-22491,Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build websites and apps. The gatsby-transformer-remark plugin prior to versions 5.25.1 and 6.3.2 passes input through to the `gray-matter` npm package which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in its default configuration unless input is sanitized.  The vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark when passing input in data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL).  Injected JavaScript executes in the context of the build server. To exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced by or added into a file processed by gatsby-transformer-remark. A patch has been introduced in `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1` and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine. As a workaround if an older version of `gatsby-transformer-remark` must be used input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing. It is encouraged for  projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.,8.1,CWE-20

CVE-2025-46343,n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.90.0 n8n is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) through the attachments view endpoint. n8n workflows can store and serve binary files which are accessible to authenticated users. However there is no restriction on the MIME type of uploaded files and the MIME type could be controlled via a GET parameter. This allows the server to respond with any MIME type potentially enabling malicious content to be interpreted and executed by the browser. An authenticated attacker with member-level permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type set to text/html the script executes in the context of the user’s session. This script could send a request to change the user’s email address in their account settings effectively enabling account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 1.90.0.,5.0,CWE-79

CVE-2023-34252,Grav is a flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.42 there is a logic flaw in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()` function whereby validation against a denylist of unsafe functions is only performed when the argument passed to filter is a string. However passing an array as a callable argument allows the validation check to be skipped. Consequently a low privileged attacker with login access to Grav Admin panel and page creation/update permissions is able to inject malicious templates to obtain remote code execution. The vulnerability can be found in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()` function declared in `/system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php`. Version 1.7.42 contains a patch for this issue. End users should also ensure that `twig.undefined_functions` and `twig.undefined_filters` properties in `/path/to/webroot/system/config/system.yaml` configuration file are set to `false` to disallow Twig from treating undefined filters/functions as PHP functions and executing them.,8.8,CWE-184

CVE-2024-32883,MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bits microcontrollers. MCUboot uses a TLV (tag-length-value) structure to represent the meta data associated with an image.  The TLVs themselves are divided into two sections a protected and an unprotected section. The protected TLV entries are included as part of the image signature to avoid tampering. However the code does not distinguish which TLV entries should be protected or not so it is possible for an attacker to add unprotected TLV entries that should be protected. Currently the primary protected TLV entries should be the dependency indication and the boot record. An injected dependency value would primarily result in an otherwise acceptable image being rejected. A boot record injection could allow fields in a later attestation record to include data not intended which could cause an image to appear to have properties that it should not have.
