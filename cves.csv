CVE-2022-39274,LoRaMac-node is a reference implementation and documentation of a LoRa network node. Versions of LoRaMac-node prior to 4.7.0 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Improper size validation of the incoming radio frames can lead to an 65280-byte out-of-bounds write. The function `ProcessRadioRxDone` implicitly expects incoming radio frames to have at least a payload of one byte or more. An empty payload leads to a 1-byte out-of-bounds read of user controlled content when the payload buffer is reused. This allows an attacker to craft a FRAME_TYPE_PROPRIETARY frame with size -1 which results in an 65280-byte out-of-bounds memcopy likely with partially controlled attacker data. Corrupting a large part if the data section is likely to cause a DoS. If the large out-of-bounds write does not immediately crash the attacker may gain control over the execution due to now controlling large parts of the data section. Users are advised to upgrade either by updating their package or by manually applying the patch commit `e851b079`.,7.5,CWE-120

CVE-2021-45492,In Sage 300 ERP (formerly accpac) through 6.8.x the installer configures the C:\Sage\Sage300\Runtime directory to be the first entry in the system-wide PATH environment variable. However this directory is writable by unprivileged users because the Sage installer fails to set explicit permissions and therefore inherits weak permissions from the C:\ folder. Because entries in the system-wide PATH variable are included in the search order for DLLs an attacker could perform DLL search-order hijacking to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM. Furthermore if the Global Search or Web Screens functionality is enabled then privilege escalation is possible via the GlobalSearchService and Sage.CNA.WindowsService services again via DLL search-order hijacking because unprivileged users would have modify permissions on the application directory. Note that while older versions of the software default to installing in %PROGRAMFILES(X86)% (which would allow the Sage folder to inherit strong permissions making the installation not vulnerable) the official Sage 300 installation guides for those versions recommend installing in C:\Sage which would make the installation vulnerable.,7.8,CWE-732

CVE-2024-35225,Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their notebook server and provide authenticated web access to them. Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host` without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>` which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4. As a workaround server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension.,9.6,CWE-79

CVE-2021-47475,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows  The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.  Commit e1f13c879a7c (staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize of usb endpoints found) inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a zero wMaxPacketSize.  Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond the buffers for example when doing descriptor fuzzing.  The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers. Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is presumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2022-31090,Guzzle an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. In affected versions when using our Curl handler it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin (change in host scheme or port) if we choose to follow it we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before continuing stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2 where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend rather than curl.,7.7,CWE-200
