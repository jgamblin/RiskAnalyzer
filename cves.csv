CVE-2025-62509,FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload editing and batch operations. Prior to version 1.4.0 a business logic flaw in FileRise’s file/folder handling allows low-privilege users to perform unauthorized operations (view/delete/modify) on files created by other users. The root cause was inferring ownership/visibility from folder names (e.g. a folder named after a username) and missing server-side authorization/ownership checks across file operation endpoints. This amounted to an IDOR pattern: an attacker could operate on resources identified only by predictable names. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0 and further hardened in version 1.5.0. A workaround for this issue involves restricting non-admin users to read-only or disable delete/rename APIs server-side avoid creating top-level folders named after other usernames and adding server-side checks that verify ownership before delete/rename/move.,8.1,CWE-280

CVE-2025-38620,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  zloop: fix KASAN use-after-free of tag set  When a zoned loop device or zloop device is removed KASAN enabled kernel reports BUG KASAN use-after-free in blk_mq_free_tag_set(). The BUG happens because zloop_ctl_remove() calls put_disk() which invokes zloop_free_disk(). The zloop_free_disk() frees the memory allocated for the zlo pointer. However after the memory is freed zloop_ctl_remove() calls blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set) which accesses the freed zlo. Hence the KASAN use-after-free.   zloop_ctl_remove()   put_disk(zlo->disk)    put_device()     kobject_put()      ...       zloop_free_disk()         kvfree(zlo)   blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set)  To avoid the BUG move the call to blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set) from zloop_ctl_remove() into zloop_free_disk(). This ensures that the tag_set is freed before the call to kvfree(zlo).,7.8,CWE-416
