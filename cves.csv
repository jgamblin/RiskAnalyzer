CVE-2022-3215,NIOHTTP1 and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and inject those newlines into the returned HTTP response. This capability allows users to work around security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests which can lead to XSS cache poisoning and a number of other flaws. This issue was resolved by adding validation to the HTTPHeaders type ensuring that there's no whitespace incorrectly present in the HTTP headers provided by users. As the existing API surface is non-failable all invalid characters are replaced by linear whitespace.,7.5,CWE-113

CVE-2023-29020,@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: ['passport' 'session'])` to clear all the session attributes by default preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.,6.5,CWE-352

CVE-2023-29001,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. The Contiki-NG operating system processes source routing headers (SRH) in its two alternative RPL protocol implementations. The IPv6 implementation uses the results of this processing to determine whether an incoming packet should be forwarded to another host. Because of missing validation of the resulting next-hop address an uncontrolled recursion may occur in the tcpip_ipv6_output function in the os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c module when receiving a packet with a next-hop address that is a local address. Attackers that have the possibility to send IPv6 packets to the Contiki-NG host can therefore trigger deeply nested recursive calls which can cause a stack overflow. The vulnerability has not been patched in the current release of Contiki-NG but is expected to be patched in the next release. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2264. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.5,CWE-674

The vulnerability may lead to Denial of Service (DoS). This issues has been fixed in sqlparse 0.4.4 by commit `c457abd5f`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,5.5,CWE-1333
CVE-2022-40735,The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that (appropriately) short exponents can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g. TLS SSH or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2025-22613,WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `informacao_adicional.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2025-29922,kcp is a Kubernetes-like control plane for form-factors and use-cases beyond Kubernetes and container workloads. Prior to 0.26.3 the identified vulnerability allows creating or deleting an object via the APIExport VirtualWorkspace in any arbitrary target workspace for pre-existing resources. By design this should only be allowed when the workspace owner decides to give access to an API provider by creating an APIBinding. With this vulnerability it is possible for an attacker to create and delete objects even if none of these requirements are satisfied i.e. even if there is no APIBinding in that workspace at all or the workspace owner has created an APIBinding but rejected a permission claim. A fix for this issue has been identified and has been published with kcp 0.26.3 and 0.27.0.,9.6,CWE-285

CVE-2025-0343,Swift ASN.1 can be caused to crash when parsing certain BER/DER constructions. This crash is caused by a confusion in the ASN.1 library itself which assumes that certain objects can only be provided in either constructed or primitive forms and will trigger a preconditionFailure if that constraint isn't met.  Importantly these constraints are actually required to be true in DER but that correctness wasn't enforced on the early node parser side so it was incorrect to rely on it later on in decoding which is what the library did.  These crashes can be triggered when parsing any DER/BER format object. There is no memory-safety issue here: the crash is a graceful one from the Swift runtime. The impact of this is that it can be used as a denial-of-service vector when parsing BER/DER data from unknown sources e.g. when parsing TLS certificates.,7.5,CWE-228
CVE-2024-12950,A vulnerability was found in code-projects Travel Management System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /subcat.php.

CVE-2023-52081,ffcss is a CLI interface to apply and configure Firefox CSS themes. Prior to 0.2.0 the function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. The `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (﹍) which would result in the omitted U+005F (_) for instance. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively while ignoring dashes underscores and dots) so the actual security impact is classified as low. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.2.0. There are no known workarounds.,5.3,CWE-74
