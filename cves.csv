CVE-2024-50186,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: explicitly clear the sk pointer when pf->create fails  We have recently noticed the exact same KASAN splat as in commit 6cd4a78d962b (net: do not leave a dangling sk pointer when socket creation fails). The problem is that commit did not fully address the problem as some pf->create implementations do not use sk_common_release in their error paths.  For example we can use the same reproducer as in the above commit but changing ping to arping. arping uses AF_PACKET socket and if packet_create fails it will just sk_free the allocated sk object.  While we could chase all the pf->create implementations and make sure they NULL the freed sk object on error from the socket we can't guarantee future protocols will not make the same mistake.  So it is easier to just explicitly NULL the sk pointer upon return from pf->create in __sock_create. We do know that pf->create always releases the allocated sk object on error so if the pointer is not NULL it is definitely dangling.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-22741,Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library compliant with the IETF RFC3261 specification. In affected versions Sofia-SIP **lacks both message length and attributes length checks** when it handles STUN packets leading to controllable heap-over-flow. For example in stun_parse_attribute() after we get the attribute's type and length value the length will be used directly to copy from the heap regardless of the message's left size. Since network users control the overflowed length and the data is written to heap chunks later attackers may achieve remote code execution by heap grooming or other exploitation methods. The bug was introduced 16 years ago in sofia-sip 1.12.4 (plus some patches through 12/21/2006) to in tree libs with git-svn-id: http://svn.freeswitch.org/svn/freeswitch/trunk@3774 d0543943-73ff-0310-b7d9-9358b9ac24b2.

CVE-2024-20294,A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) feature of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.    This vulnerability is due to improper handling of specific fields in an LLDP frame.

CVE-2022-49568,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: Don't null dereference ops->destroy  A KVM device cleanup happens in either of two callbacks: 1) destroy() which is called when the VM is being destroyed; 2) release() which is called when a device fd is closed.  Most KVM devices use 1) but Book3s's interrupt controller KVM devices (XICS XIVE XIVE-native) use 2) as they need to close and reopen during the machine execution. The error handling in kvm_ioctl_create_device() assumes destroy() is always defined which leads to NULL dereference as discovered by Syzkaller.  This adds a checks for destroy!=NULL and adds a missing release().  This is not changing kvm_destroy_devices() as devices with defined release() should have been removed from the KVM devices list by then.,5.5,CWE-476
