CVE-2023-37896,Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner. Prior to version 2.9.9 a security issue in the Nuclei project affected users utilizing Nuclei as Go code (SDK) running custom templates. This issue did not affect CLI users. The problem was related to sanitization issues with payload loading in sandbox mode. There was a potential risk with payloads loading in sandbox mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths not being converted to absolute paths before doing the check for `sandbox` flag allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem in certain cases when using Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation.   This issue has been fixed in version 2.9.9. The maintainers have also enabled sandbox by default for filesystem loading. This can be optionally disabled if required. The `-sandbox` option has been deprecated and is now divided into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which is enabled by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which can be enabled by users optionally. The `-lfa` allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system (disabling sandbox effectively) and `-lna` blocks connections to the local/private network.,7.5,CWE-22
CVE-2024-53258,Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. From Autolab versions v.3.0.0 onward students can download all assignments from another student as long as they are logged in using the download_all_submissions feature. This can allow for leakage of submissions to unauthorized users such as downloading submissions from other students in the class or even instructor test submissions given they know their user IDs. This issue has been patched in commit `1aa4c769` which is not yet in a release version but is expected to be included in version 3.0.3. Users are advised to either manually patch or to wait for version 3.0.3. As a workaround administrators can disable the feature.,5.3,CWE-359

CVE-2024-45004,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix leak of blob encryption key  Trusted keys unseal the key blob on load but keep the sealed payload in the blob field so that every subsequent read (export) will simply convert this field to hex and send it to userspace.  With DCP-based trusted keys we decrypt the blob encryption key (BEK) in the Kernel due hardware limitations and then decrypt the blob payload. BEK decryption is done in-place which means that the trusted key blob field is modified and it consequently holds the BEK in plain text. Every subsequent read of that key thus send the plain text BEK instead of the encrypted BEK to userspace.  This issue only occurs when importing a trusted DCP-based key and then exporting it again. This should rarely happen as the common use cases are to either create a new trusted key and export it or import a key blob and then just use it without exporting it again.  Fix this by performing BEK decryption and encryption in a dedicated buffer. Further always wipe the plain text BEK buffer to prevent leaking the key via uninitialized memory.,5.5,CWE-312
