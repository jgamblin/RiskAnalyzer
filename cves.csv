CVE-2024-25121,TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. In affected versions of TYPO3 entities of the File Abstraction Layer (FAL) could be persisted directly via `DataHandler`. This allowed attackers to reference files in the fallback storage directly and retrieve their file names and contents. The fallback storage (zero-storage) is used as a backward compatibility layer for files located outside properly configured file storages and within the public web root directory. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 version 8.7.57 ELTS 9.5.46 ELTS 10.4.43 ELTS 11.5.35 LTS 12.4.11 LTS or 13.0.1 which fix the problem described. When persisting entities of the File Abstraction Layer directly via DataHandler `sys_file` entities are now denied by default and `sys_file_reference` & `sys_file_metadata` entities are not permitted to reference files in the fallback storage anymore. When importing data from secure origins this must be explicitly enabled in the corresponding DataHandler instance by using `$dataHandler->isImporting = true;`.   ,7.1,CWE-200

CVE-2023-36811,borgbackup is an opensource deduplicating archiver with compression and authenticated encryption. A flaw in the cryptographic authentication scheme in borgbackup allowed an attacker to fake archives and potentially indirectly cause backup data loss in the repository. The attack requires an attacker to be able to: 1. insert files (with no additional headers) into backups and 2. gain write access to the repository. This vulnerability does not disclose plaintext to the attacker nor does it affect the authenticity of existing archives. Creating plausible fake archives may be feasible for empty or small archives but is unlikely for large archives. The issue has been fixed in borgbackup 1.2.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Additionally to installing the fixed code users must follow the upgrade procedure as documented in the change log. Data loss after being attacked can be avoided by reviewing the archives (timestamp and contents valid and as expected) after any borg check --repair and before borg prune. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.7,CWE-347

CVE-2023-3823,In PHP versions 8.0.* before 8.0.30 8.1.* before 8.1.22 and 8.2.* before 8.2.8 various XML functions rely on libxml global state to track configuration variables like whether external entities are loaded. This state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly changes it by calling appropriate function. However since the state is process-global other modules - such as ImageMagick - may also use this library within the same process and change that global state for their internal purposes and leave it in a state where external entities loading is enabled. This can lead to the situation where external XML is parsed with external entities loaded which can lead to disclosure of any local files accessible to PHP. This vulnerable state may persist in the same process across many requests until the process is shut down.,8.6,CWE-611

CVE-2022-29238,Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. Prior to version 6.4.12 authenticated requests to the notebook server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing the contents of hidden directories not accessing individual hidden files or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to be disallowed. Because fully authenticated requests are required this is of relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitive files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh` while serving $HOME) then any authenticated requests could access files if their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access to the server and therefore execution permissions which also generally grants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result in any privilege escalation or increase in information access only an additional unintended means by which the files could be accessed. Version 6.4.12 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.,4.3,CWE-425

CVE-2024-45305,gix-path is a crate of the gitoxide project dealing with git paths and their conversions. `gix-path` executes `git` to find the path of a configuration file that belongs to the `git` installation itself but mistakenly treats the local repository's configuration as system-wide if no higher scoped configuration is found. In rare cases this causes a less trusted repository to be treated as more trusted or leaks sensitive information from one repository to another such as sending credentials to another repository's remote. In `gix_path::env` the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` and parses the first line of the output to extract the path to the configuration file holding the configuration variable of highest scope. It is believed to be very difficult to exploit this vulnerability deliberately due to the need either to anticipate a situation in which higher-scoped configuration variables would be absent or to arrange for this to happen. Although any operating system may be affected users running Apple Git on macOS are much less likely to be affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.10.10.

CVE-2024-37021,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fpga: manager: add owner module and take its refcount  The current implementation of the fpga manager assumes that the low-level module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the manager if the parent device does not have a driver.  To address this problem add a module owner pointer to the fpga_manager struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for registering the manager to take an additional owner module parameter and rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper macros that automatically set the module that registers the manager as the owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and reduces the chances of registering a manager without setting the owner.  Also update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface for registering an fpga manager.  Other changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_mgr_get() to fpga_mgr_get() and of_fpga_mgr_get() to improve code clarity since the manager device is taken in these functions.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-38049,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/resctrl: Fix allocation of cleanest CLOSID on platforms with no monitors  Commit    6eac36bb9eb0 (x86/resctrl: Allocate the cleanest CLOSID by searching closid_num_dirty_rmid)  added logic that causes resctrl to search for the CLOSID with the fewest dirty cache lines when creating a new control group if requested by the arch code. This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID.  This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters.  This causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the array was not allocated by dom_data_init().  As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy monitors add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is allocated.,5.5,CWE-476
