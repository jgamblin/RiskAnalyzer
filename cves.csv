CVE-2023-49092,RustCrypto/RSA is a portable RSA implementation in pure Rust. Due to a non-constant-time implementation information about the private key is leaked through timing information which is observable over the network. An attacker may be able to use that information to recover the key. There is currently no fix available. As a workaround avoid using the RSA crate in settings where attackers are able to observe timing information e.g. local use on a non-compromised computer.,5.9,CWE-385

CVE-2022-21657,Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions Envoy does not restrict the set of certificates it accepts from the peer either as a TLS client or a TLS server to only those certificates that contain the necessary extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth respectively). This means that a peer may present an e-mail certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection) either as a leaf certificate or as a CA in the chain and it will be accepted for TLS. This is particularly bad when combined with the issue described in pull request #630 in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for use with S/MIME and thus exempted from audit or supervision to issue TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.,6.8,CWE-295

CVE-2024-26789,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: arm64/neonbs - fix out-of-bounds access on short input  The bit-sliced implementation of AES-CTR operates on blocks of 128 bytes and will fall back to the plain NEON version for tail blocks or inputs that are shorter than 128 bytes to begin with.  It will call straight into the plain NEON asm helper which performs all memory accesses in granules of 16 bytes (the size of a NEON register). For this reason the associated plain NEON glue code will copy inputs shorter than 16 bytes into a temporary buffer given that this is a rare occurrence and it is not worth the effort to work around this in the asm code.  The fallback from the bit-sliced NEON version fails to take this into account potentially resulting in out-of-bounds accesses. So clone the same workaround and use a temp buffer for short in/outputs.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2022-23507,Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.,5.4,CWE-347

CVE-2023-48309,NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name email access_token etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround using a custom authorization callback for Middleware developers can manually do a basic authentication.,5.3,CWE-285
