CVE-2024-50229,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks  Syzbot reported that page_symlink() called by nilfs_symlink() triggers memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer which can result in circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore nilfs->ns_segctor_sem s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the fs_reclaim pseudo lock.  This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (don't put symlink bodies in pagecache into highmem) the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().  This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device because the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink() the gfp flags remain overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then memory allocation called from page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:  Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and __nilfs_read_inode() do as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-28857,Apereo CAS is an open source multilingual single sign-on solution for the web. Apereo CAS can be configured to use authentication based on client X509 certificates. These certificates can be provided via TLS handshake or a special HTTP header such as “ssl_client_cert”. When checking the validity of the provided client certificate X509CredentialsAuthenticationHandler performs check that this certificate is not revoked. To do so it fetches URLs provided in the “CRL Distribution Points” extension of the certificate which are taken from the certificate itself and therefore can be controlled by a malicious user. If the CAS server is configured to use an LDAP server for x509 authentication with a password for example by setting a “cas.authn.x509.ldap.ldap-url” and “cas.authn.x509.ldap.bind-credential” properties X509CredentialsAuthenticationHandler fetches revocation URLs from the certificate which can be LDAP urls. When making requests to this LDAP urls Apereo CAS uses the same password as for initially configured LDAP server which can lead to a password leak. An unauthenticated user can leak the password used to LDAP connection configured on server. This issue has been addressed in version 6.6.6. Users are advised to upgrade.
