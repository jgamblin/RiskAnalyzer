CVE-2025-46392,Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x.  There are a number of issues in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x that allow excessive resource consumption when loading untrusted configurations or using unexpected usage patterns. The Apache Commons Configuration team does not intend to fix these issues in 1.x. Apache Commons Configuration 1.x is still safe to use in scenario's where you only load trusted configurations.    Users that load untrusted configurations or give attackers control over usage patterns are recommended to upgrade to the 2.x version line which fixes these issues. Apache Commons Configuration 2.x is not a drop-in replacement but as it uses a separate Maven groupId and Java package namespace they can be loaded side-by-side making it possible to do a gradual migration.,6.5,CWE-400

CVE-2023-27577,flarum is a forum software package for building communities. In versions prior to 1.7.0 an admin account which has already been compromised by an attacker may use a vulnerability in the `LESS` parser which can be exploited to read sensitive files on the server through the use of path traversal techniques. An attacker can achieve this by providing an absolute path to a sensitive file in the custom `LESS` setting which the `LESS` parser will then read. For example an attacker could use the following code to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a linux machine. The scope of what files are vulnerable will depend on the permissions given to the running flarum process. The vulnerability has been addressed in version `1.7`. Users should upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the vulnerability by ensuring that their admin accounts are secured with strong passwords and follow other best practices for account security. Additionally users can limit the exposure of sensitive files on the server by implementing appropriate file permissions and access controls at the operating system level. ,6.6,CWE-22

CVE-2024-8404,An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF specifically affecting Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder.   Important: In most installations this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.  Update:  This CVE has been updated in May 2025 to update the fixed version and fix process. Please refer to the May 2025 Security Bulletin.  Note:   This CVE has been split from CVE-2024-3037.,7.8,CWE-59

CVE-2023-40167,Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Prior to versions 9.4.52 10.0.16 11.0.16 and 12.0.1 Jetty accepts the `+` character proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field.  This is more permissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with 400 responses.  There is no known exploit scenario but it is conceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400 response. Versions 9.4.52 10.0.16 11.0.16 and 12.0.1 contain a patch for this issue. There is no workaround as there is no known exploit scenario.,5.3,CWE-130

CVE-2023-33977,Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and automated testing. Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans test cases etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files from being uploaded and Content-Security-Policy definition to prevent cross-site-scripting attacks. The upload validation checks were not 100% robust which left the possibility to circumvent them and upload a potentially dangerous file which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. Additionally we've discovered that Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive will strip some headers negating protections built into Kiwi TCMS when served behind a reverse proxy. This issue has been addressed in version 12.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade who are serving Kiwi TCMS behind a reverse proxy should make sure that additional header values are still passed to the client browser. If they aren't redefining them inside the proxy configuration.,8.1,CWE-79

CVE-2024-31991,Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0 the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server. Based on the content of the response it will either parse the content or disregard it. This function nor those that call it add any restrictions on the URL that can be provided nor is it restricted to being an FQDN (i.e. an IP address can be provided).

CVE-2025-48936,Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to versions 2.70.12 2.71.10 and 3.2.2 a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link containing a secret code is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g. via host header injection) they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 2.70.12 2.71.10 and 3.2.2.,8.1,CWE-601

CVE-2025-54139,HAX CMS allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJS or PHP backend. In haxcms-nodejs versions 11.0.12 and below and in haxcms-php versions 11.0.7 and below all pages within the HAX CMS application do not contain headers to prevent other websites from loading the site within an iframe. This applies to both the CMS and generated sites. An unauthenticated attacker can load the standalone login page or other sensitive functionality within an iframe performing a UI redressing attack (clickjacking). This can be used to perform social engineering attacks to attempt to coerce users into performing unintended actions within the HAX CMS application. This is fixed in haxcms-nodejs version 11.0.13 and haxcms-php 11.0.8.,4.3,CWE-1021

CVE-2022-48892,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/core: Fix use-after-free bug in dup_user_cpus_ptr()  Since commit 07ec77a1d4e8 (sched: Allow task CPU affinity to be restricted on asymmetric systems) the setting and clearing of user_cpus_ptr are done under pi_lock for arm64 architecture. However dup_user_cpus_ptr() accesses user_cpus_ptr without any lock protection. Since sched_setaffinity() can be invoked from another process the process being modified may be undergoing fork() at the same time.  When racing with the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in __set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked() it can lead to user-after-free and possibly double-free in arm64 kernel.  Commit 8f9ea86fdf99 (sched: Always preserve the user requested cpumask) fixes this problem as user_cpus_ptr once set will never be cleared in a task's lifetime. However this bug was re-introduced in commit 851a723e45d1 (sched: Always clear user_cpus_ptr in do_set_cpus_allowed()) which allows the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in do_set_cpus_allowed(). This time it will affect all arches.  Fix this bug by always clearing the user_cpus_ptr of the newly cloned/forked task before the copying process starts and check the user_cpus_ptr state of the source task under pi_lock.  Note to stable this patch won't be applicable to stable releases. Just copy the new dup_user_cpus_ptr() function over.,7.8,CWE-415
