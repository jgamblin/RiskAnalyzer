Users who have generated a microservice Gateway using the affected version may be impacted as Gateways are reactive by default. Currently SQL injection is possible in the findAllBy(Pageable pageable Criteria criteria) method of an entity repository class generated in these applications as the where clause using Criteria for queries are not sanitized and user input is passed on as it is by the criteria. This issue has been patched in v7.8.1. Users unable to upgrade should be careful when combining criterias and conditions as the root of the issue lies in the `EntityManager.java` class when creating the where clause via `Conditions.just(criteria.toString())`. `just` accepts the literal string provided. Criteria's `toString` method returns a plain string and this combination is vulnerable to sql injection as the string is not sanitized and will contain whatever used passed as input using any plain SQL.,8.1,CWE-89

CVE-2023-29020,@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: ['passport' 'session'])` to clear all the session attributes by default preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.,6.5,CWE-352

CVE-2024-26831,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1  Recently handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:  Expected handshake_req_destroy_test == req but     handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000     req == 0000000060f99b40 not ok 11 req_destroy works  This is because sock_release(sock) was replaced with fput(filp) to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.  The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel() followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the final close is complete before it checks the pointer.  We cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never called (ie there is an API bug) then the test will hang.  Reported by: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>,5.5,CWE-401
