CVE-2025-21639,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: sysctl: rto_min/max: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only   from the opener's netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases resulting in an 'Oops'   (null-ptr-deref) e.g. when the current task is exiting as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using container_of().

CVE-2022-1343,The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL ocsp application. When verifying an ocsp response with the -no_cert_checks option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result.

CVE-2024-35846,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory  Christian reports a NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap shrinker.  The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1] and the Red Hat bugzilla [2].  The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag the zswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL.  This is okay in many places like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in memcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of cgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.  Nhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case and I was then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.

CVE-2025-32869,A vulnerability has been identified in TeleControl Server Basic (All versions < V3.1.2.2). The affected application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the internally used 'ImportCertificate' method. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to bypass authorization controls to read from and write to the application's database and execute code with NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService permissions. A successful attack requires the attacker to be able to access port 8000 on a system where a vulnerable version of the affected application is executed on.,8.8,CWE-89
CVE-2022-34875,This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader 11.2.1.53537. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of ADBC objects. By performing actions in JavaScript an attacker can trigger a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16981.,3.3,CWE-125
CVE-2022-31127,NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com <a href=http://attacker.com>Before signing in claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com` and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4 as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest` you only need to upgrade. Otherwise make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it.,7.1,CWE-79

CVE-2024-56140,Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. In affected versions a bug in Astro’s CSRF-protection middleware allows requests to bypass CSRF checks. When the `security.checkOrigin` configuration option is set to `true` Astro middleware will perform a CSRF check. However a vulnerability exists that can bypass this security. A semicolon-delimited parameter is allowed after the type in `Content-Type`. Web browsers will treat a `Content-Type` such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; abc` as a `simple request` and will not perform preflight validation. In this case CSRF is not blocked as expected. Additionally the `Content-Type` header is not required for a request. This issue has been addressed in version 4.16.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.9,CWE-352
