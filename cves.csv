CVE-2025-53097,Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to version 3.20.3 there was an issue where the Roo Code agent's `search_files` tool did not respect the setting to disable reads outside of the VS Code workspace. This means that an attacker who was able to inject a prompt into the agent could potentially read a sensitive file and then write the information to a JSON schema. Users have the option to disable schema fetching in VS Code but the feature is enabled by default. For users with this feature enabled writing to the schema would trigger a network request without the user having a chance to deny. This issue is of moderate severity since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent. Version 3.20.3 fixed the issue where `search_files` did not respect the setting to limit it to the workspace. This reduces the scope of the damage if an attacker is able to take control of the agent through prompt injection or another vector.,5.9,CWE-74

Prior to version 1.17.1 if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir` that contains the starting user's home directory then the underlying REST API can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time by guessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requires an authenticated user session this URL can be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting critical files such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys allowing a malicious user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issue is patched in version 1.17.1.,7.1,CWE-200

CVE-2025-39788,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ufs: exynos: Fix programming of HCI_UTRL_NEXUS_TYPE  On Google gs101 the number of UTP transfer request slots (nutrs) is 32 and in this case the driver ends up programming the UTRL_NEXUS_TYPE incorrectly as 0.  This is because the left hand side of the shift is 1 which is of type int i.e. 31 bits wide. Shifting by more than that width results in undefined behaviour.  Fix this by switching to the BIT() macro which applies correct type casting as required. This ensures the correct value is written to UTRL_NEXUS_TYPE (0xffffffff on gs101) and it also fixes a UBSAN shift warning:      UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/ufs/host/ufs-exynos.c:1113:21     shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'  For consistency apply the same change to the nutmrs / UTMRL_NEXUS_TYPE write.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2025-39689,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftrace: Also allocate and copy hash for reading of filter files  Currently the reader of set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace just adds the pointer to the global tracer hash to its iterator. Unlike the writer that allocates a copy of the hash the reader keeps the pointer to the filter hashes. This is problematic because this pointer is static across function calls that release the locks that can update the global tracer hashes. This can cause UAF and similar bugs.  Allocate and copy the hash for reading the filter files like it is done for the writers. This not only fixes UAF bugs but also makes the code a bit simpler as it doesn't have to differentiate when to free the iterator's hash between writers and readers.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-43863,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling  Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove the fence from the pending list and thus doesn't require a lock to fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.  vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all fences and update their status to do that it holds a lock to prevent the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending fences for which it holds a lock.  dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll calls the wait which signals the fences which are being destroyed. The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it was called.  Old bug but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling interfaces. Fix those in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-59789,Uncontrolled recursion in the json2pb component in Apache bRPC (version < 1.15.0) on all platforms allows remote attackers to make the server crash via sending deep recursive json data.  Root Cause: The bRPC json2pb component uses rapidjson to parse json data from the network. The rapidjson parser uses a recursive parsing method by default. If the input json has a large depth of recursive structure the parser function may run into stack overflow.  Affected Scenarios: Use bRPC server with protobuf message to serve http+json requests from untrusted network. Or directly use JsonToProtoMessage to convert json from untrusted input.    How to Fix:  (Choose one of the following options)  1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.15.0 which fixes this issue. 2. Apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/3099     Note: No matter which option   you choose you should know that the fix introduces a recursion depth limit with default value 100. It affects these functions:   ProtoMessageToJson ProtoMessageToProtoJson JsonToProtoMessage and ProtoJsonToProtoMessage.   If your requests contain json or protobuf messages that have a depth exceeding the limit the request will be failed after applying the fix. You can modify the gflag json2pb_max_recursion_depth to change the limit.,7.5,CWE-674

CVE-2025-37918,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: btusb: avoid NULL pointer dereference in skb_dequeue()  A NULL pointer dereference can occur in skb_dequeue() when processing a QCA firmware crash dump on WCN7851 (0489:e0f3).  [ 93.672166] Bluetooth: hci0: ACL memdump size(589824)  [ 93.672475] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference address: 0000000000000008 [ 93.672517] Workqueue: hci0 hci_devcd_rx [bluetooth] [ 93.672598] RIP: 0010:skb_dequeue+0x50/0x80  The issue stems from handle_dump_pkt_qca() returning 0 even when a dump packet is successfully processed. This is because it incorrectly forwards the return value of hci_devcd_init() (which returns 0 on success). As a result the caller (btusb_recv_acl_qca() or btusb_recv_evt_qca()) assumes the packet was not handled and passes it to hci_recv_frame() leading to premature kfree() of the skb.  Later hci_devcd_rx() attempts to dequeue the same skb from the dump queue resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.  Fix this by: 1. Making handle_dump_pkt_qca() return 0 on success and negative errno    on failure consistent with kernel conventions. 2. Splitting dump packet detection into separate functions for ACL    and event packets for better structure and readability.  This ensures dump packets are properly identified and consumed avoiding double handling and preventing NULL pointer access.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-49203,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Fix double free during GPU reset on DC streams  [Why] The issue only occurs during the GPU reset code path.  We first backup the current state prior to commiting 0 streams internally from DM to DC. This state backup contains valid link encoder assignments.  DC will clear the link encoder assignments as part of current state (but not the backup since it was a copied before the commit) and free the extra stream reference it held.  DC requires that the link encoder assignments remain cleared/invalid prior to commiting. Since the backup still has valid assignments we call the interface post reset to clear them. This routine also releases the extra reference that the link encoder interface held - resulting in a double free (and eventually a NULL pointer dereference).  [How] We'll have to do a full DC commit anyway after GPU reset because the stream count previously went to 0.  We don't need to retain the assignment that we had backed up so just copy off of the now clean current state assignment after the reset has occcurred with the new link_enc_cfg_copy() interface.,5.5,CWE-415

To avoid this select the cpu with cpumask_any_and_distribute() to mask __pod_cpumask with cpu_online_mask. In case no cpu is left in the pool skip the assignment.  tj: This doesn't fully fix the bug as CPUs can still go down between picking the target CPU and the wake call. Fixing that likely requires adding cpu_online() test to either the sched or s390 arch code. However regardless of how that is fixed workqueue shouldn't be picking a CPU which isn't online as that would result in unpredictable and worse behavior.,6.2,CWE-476

CVE-2023-25809,runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In affected versions it was found that rootless runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when runc is executed inside the user namespace and the `config.json` does not specify the cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.. `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host` with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc is executed outside the user namespace and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind ro` (e.g. `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare). A container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other users's cgroup hierarchies are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts. or add `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`. ,5.0,CWE-281
