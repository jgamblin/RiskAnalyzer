CVE-2024-26696,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()  Syzbot reported a hang issue in migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind() and nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2.  While migrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback to complete the log writer thread that should bring the writeback to completion picks up the folio being written back in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log creation and was trying to lock the folio.  Thus causing a deadlock.  In the first place it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of writeback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to verify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at mount so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is broken an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.  Investigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback completion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional and if the backing device does not require stable writes data may be modified without waiting.  Fix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to finish regardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-0290,Rapid7 Velociraptor did not properly sanitize the client ID parameter to the CreateCollection API allowing a directory traversal in where the collection task could be written. It was possible to provide a client id of ../clients/server to schedule the collection for the server (as a server artifact) but only require privileges to schedule collections on the client.  Normally to schedule an artifact on the server the COLLECT_SERVER permission is required. This permission is normally only granted to administrator role. Due to this issue it is sufficient to have the COLLECT_CLIENT privilege which is normally granted to the investigator role. To exploit this vulnerability the attacker must already have a Velociraptor user account at least investigator level and be able to authenticate to the GUI and issue an API call to the backend. Typically most users deploy Velociraptor with limited access to a trusted group and most users will already be administrators within the GUI.  This issue affects Velociraptor versions before 0.6.7-5.

CVE-2022-48711,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tipc: improve size validations for received domain records  The function tipc_mon_rcv() allows a node to receive and process domain_record structs from peer nodes to track their views of the network topology.  This patch verifies that the number of members in a received domain record does not exceed the limit defined by MAX_MON_DOMAIN something that may otherwise lead to a stack overflow.  tipc_mon_rcv() is called from the function tipc_link_proto_rcv() where we are reading a 32 bit message data length field into a uint16.  To avert any risk of bit overflow we add an extra sanity check for this in that function.  We cannot see that happen with the current code but future designers being unaware of this risk may introduce it by allowing delivery of very large (> 64k) sk buffers from the bearer layer.

CVE-2024-28121,stimulus_reflex is a system to extend the capabilities of both Rails and Stimulus by intercepting user interactions and passing them to Rails over real-time websockets. In affected versions more methods than expected can be called on reflex instances. Being able to call some of them has security implications. To invoke a reflex a websocket message of the following shape is sent: `\target\:\[class_name]#[method_name]\\args\:[]`. The server will proceed to instantiate `reflex` using the provided `class_name` as long as it extends `StimulusReflex::Reflex`. It then attempts to call `method_name` on the instance with the provided arguments. This is problematic as `reflex.method method_name` can be more methods that those explicitly specified by the developer in their reflex class. A good example is the instance_variable_set method. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 3.4.2 and 3.5.0.rc4. Users unable to upgrade should: see the backing GHSA advisory for mitigation advice.,8.8,CWE-470

CVE-2025-6985,The HTMLSectionSplitter class in langchain-text-splitters version 0.3.8 is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to unsafe XSLT parsing. This vulnerability arises because the class allows the use of arbitrary XSLT stylesheets which are parsed using lxml.etree.parse() and lxml.etree.XSLT() without any hardening measures. In lxml versions up to 4.9.x external entities are resolved by default allowing attackers to read arbitrary local files or perform outbound HTTP(S) fetches. In lxml versions 5.0 and above while entity expansion is disabled the XSLT document() function can still read any URI unless XSLTAccessControl is applied. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain read-only access to any file the LangChain process can reach including sensitive files such as SSH keys environment files source code or cloud metadata. No authentication special privileges or user interaction are required and the issue is exploitable in default deployments that enable custom XSLT.,7.5,CWE-611

CVE-2023-0594,Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.   Starting with the 7.0 branch Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability in the trace view visualization.   The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due the value of a span's attributes/resources were not properly sanitized and this will be rendered when the span's attributes/resources are expanded.  An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change the value of a trace view visualization to contain JavaScript.   This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.   Users may upgrade to version 8.5.21 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.   ,7.3,CWE-79
CVE-2024-13028,A vulnerability which was classified as problematic has been found in Antabot White-Jotter up to 0.2.2. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /login. The manipulation of the argument username leads to observable response discrepancy. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.,3.7,CWE-203
CVE-2022-34599,H3C Magic R200 R200V200R004L02 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the EdittriggerList interface at /goform/aspForm.,9.8,CWE-787
CVE-2023-28354,An issue was discovered in Opsview Monitor Agent 6.8. An unauthenticated remote attacker can call check_nrpe against affected targets specifying known NRPE plugins which in default installations are configured to accept command control characters and pass them to command-line interpreters for NRPE plugin execution. This allows the attacker to escape NRPE plugin execution and execute commands remotely on the target as NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.,9.8,CWE-94
CVE-2024-42452,A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows a low-privileged user to start an agent remotely in server mode and obtain credentials effectively escalating privileges to system-level access. This allows the attacker to upload files to the server with elevated privileges. The vulnerability exists because remote calls bypass permission checks leading to full system compromise.,8.8,CWE-863
CVE-2022-26464,In vow there is a possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07032699; Issue ID: ALPS07032699.,6.7,CWE-787
CVE-2024-41270,An issue discovered in the RunHTTPServer function in Gorush v1.18.4 allows attackers to intercept and manipulate data due to use of deprecated TLS version.,9.1,CWE-327
CVE-2024-26483,An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Profile Image module of Kirby CMS v4.1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file.,8.8,CWE-94
CVE-2024-47490,An Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows an unauthenticated network based attacker to cause increased consumption of resources ultimately resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  When specific transit MPLS packets are received by the PFE these packets are internally forwarded to the Routing Engine (RE) rather than being handled appropriately. Continuous receipt of these MPLS packets causes resources to be exhausted. MPLS config is not required to be affected by this issue.    This issue affects Junos OS Evolved ACX 7000 Series:       *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9-EVO   *  22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO    *  22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S3-EVO    *  22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S2-EVO    *  23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO    *  23.4-EVO before 23.4R1-S1-EVO 23.4R2-EVO.,8.2,CWE-923
CVE-2023-29197,guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library implementation in PHP. Affected versions are subject to improper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a newline (\n) into both the header names and values. While the specification states that \r\n\r\n is used to terminate the header list many servers in the wild will also accept \n\n. This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-24775 where the fix was incomplete. The issue has been patched in versions 1.9.1 and 2.4.5. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.,5.3,CWE-436
