CVE-2022-45790,The Omron FINS protocol has an authenticated feature to prevent access to memory regions. Authentication is susceptible to bruteforce attack which may allow an adversary to gain access to protected memory. This access can allow overwrite of values including programmed logic.,8.6,CWE-307
CVE-2023-32076,in-toto is a framework to protect supply chain integrity. The in-toto configuration is read from various directories and allows users to configure the behavior of the framework. The files are from directories following the XDG base directory specification. In versions 1.4.0 and prior among the files read is `.in_totorc` which is a hidden file in the directory in which in-toto is run. If an attacker controls the inputs to a supply chain step they can mask their activities by also passing in an `.in_totorc` file that includes the necessary exclude patterns and settings. RC files are widely used in other systems and security issues have been discovered in their implementations as well. Maintainers found in their conversations with in-toto adopters that `in_totorc` is not their preferred way to configure in-toto. As none of the options supported in `in_totorc` is unique and can be set elsewhere using API parameters or CLI arguments the maintainers decided to drop support for `in_totorc`. in-toto's `user_settings` module has been dropped altogether in commit 3a21d84f40811b7d191fa7bd17265c1f99599afd. Users may also sandbox functionary code as a security measure.,5.5,CWE-15

CVE-2022-39308,GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions from 19.2.0 to 19.10.0 (inclusive) are subject to a timing attack in validation of access tokens due to use of regular string comparison for validation of the token rather than a constant time algorithm.

This issue is fixed in GoCD version 19.11.0. As a workaround users can apply rate limiting or insert random delays to API calls made to GoCD Server via a reverse proxy or other fronting web server. Another workaround users may disallow use of access tokens by users by having an administrator revoke all access tokens through the Access Token Management admin function.,6.5,CWE-208

CVE-2023-46233,crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version 4.2.0 crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993 and at least 1300000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1 a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005 and defaults to one single iteration a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords the impact is high. If used to generate signatures the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at least 250000 iterations.,9.1,CWE-328

CVE-2024-50271,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  signal: restore the override_rlimit logic  Prior to commit d64696905554 (Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of ucounts) UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally even if override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.    For example if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV signal sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the signal delivery preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo.  This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and handling the error.  From the user-space perspective applications are unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes as we observed with java applications.  Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively restores the old behavior.,5.5,CWE-770

CVE-2024-49363,Misskey is an open source federated social media platform. In affected versions FileServerService (media proxy) in github.com/misskey-dev/misskey 2024.10.1 or earlier did not detect proxy loops which allows remote actors to execute a self-propagating reflected/amplified distributed denial-of-service via a maliciously crafted note. FileServerService.prototype.proxyHandler did not check incoming requests are not coming from another proxy server. An attacker can execute an amplified denial-of-service by sending a nested proxy request to the server and end the request with a malicious redirect back to another nested proxy request. Leading to unbounded recursion until the original request is timed out. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may configure the reverse proxy to block requests to the proxy with an empty User-Agent header or one containing Misskey/. An attacker can not effectively modify the User-Agent header without making another request to the server.,7.4,CWE-405

CVE-2025-31477,The Tauri shell plugin allows access to the system shell. Prior to 2.2.1 the Tauri shell plugin exposes functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The open endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. xdg-open on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like https or mailto by default. This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file:// smb:// or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.1.,9.8,CWE-20

CVE-2024-40640,vodozemac is an open source implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust.  Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack. The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material. The impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.  Additionally the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper. This has been patched in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272 which has been included in release version 0.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
