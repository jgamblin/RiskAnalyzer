CVE-2022-49187,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: Fix clk_hw_get_clk() when dev is NULL  Any registered clk_core structure can have a NULL pointer in its dev field. While never actually documented this is evidenced by the wide usage of clk_register and clk_hw_register with a NULL device pointer and the fact that the core of_clk_hw_register() function also passes a NULL device pointer.  A call to clk_hw_get_clk() on a clk_hw struct whose clk_core is in that case will result in a NULL pointer derefence when it calls dev_name() on that NULL device pointer.

CVE-2025-27145,copyparty a portable file server has a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in versions prior to 1.16.15. The vulnerability is considered low-risk. By handing someone a maliciously-named file and then tricking them into dragging the file into copyparty's Web-UI an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript with the same privileges as that user. For example this could give unintended read-access to files owned by that user. The bug is triggered by the drag-drop action itself; it is not necessary to actually initiate the upload. The file must be empty (zero bytes). Note that as a general-purpose webserver it is intentionally possible to upload HTML-files with arbitrary javascript in `<script>` tags which will execute when the file is opened. The difference is that this vulnerability would trigger execution of javascript during the act of uploading and not when the uploaded file was opened. Version 1.16.15 contains a fix.,3.6,CWE-79

CVE-2025-22107,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()  There are actually 2 problems: - deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements   [i + 1 end) over it. Actually element i+1 is out of bounds. - The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements because the last   element is out of bounds.  The out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being accessed so the problem is only that we touch it not that it becomes in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds element is part of an unmapped page.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2024-23340,@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0 @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API if the URL contains `..` here called double dots the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround don't use `serveStatic`.  ,5.3,CWE-22

CVE-2023-48229,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds write exists in the driver for IEEE 802.15.4 radios on nRF platforms in the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem is triggered when parsing radio frames in the `read_frame` function in the `arch/cpu/nrf/net/nrf-ieee-driver-arch.c` module. More specifically the `read_frame` function performs an incomplete validation of the payload length of the packet which is a value that can be set by an external party that sends radio packets to a Contiki-NG system. Although the value is validated to be in the range of the MTU length it is not validated to fit into the given buffer into which the packet will be copied. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to update their develop branch or to update to a subsequent release when available. Users unable to upgrade should consider manually applying the changes in PR #2741.,7.0,CWE-787
