CVE-2023-34241,OpenPrinting CUPS is a standards-based open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.6 CUPS logs data of free memory to the logging service AFTER the connection has been closed when it should have logged the data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.  The exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con->http)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always provided its argument is not null frees the pointer at the end of the call only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.

CVE-2023-4421,The NSS code used for checking PKCS#1 v1.5 was leaking information useful in mounting Bleichenbacher-like attacks. Both the overall correctness of the padding as well as the length of the encrypted message was leaking through timing side-channel. By sending large number of attacker-selected ciphertexts the attacker would be able to decrypt a previously intercepted PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext (for example to decrypt a TLS session that used RSA key exchange) or forge a signature using the victim's key. The issue was fixed by implementing the implicit rejection algorithm in which the NSS returns a deterministic random message in case invalid padding is detected as proposed in the Marvin Attack paper. This vulnerability affects NSS < 3.61.,6.5,CWE-203

CVE-2025-25187,Joplin is a free open source note taking and to-do application which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true` allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.8,CWE-79

CVE-2023-52811,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ibmvfc: Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event pool  In practice the driver should never send more commands than are allocated to a queue's event pool. In the unlikely event that this happens the code asserts a BUG_ON and in the case that the kernel is not configured to crash on panic returns a junk event pointer from the empty event list causing things to spiral from there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifact of the ibmvfc driver first being upstreamed and it is well known now that the use of BUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverable scenario. There is nothing about this scenario that prevents the driver from recovering and carrying on.  Remove the BUG_ON in question from ibmvfc_get_event() and return a NULL pointer in the case of an empty event pool. Update all call sites to ibmvfc_get_event() to check for a NULL pointer and perfrom the appropriate failure or recovery action.,5.5,CWE-476
