CVE-2025-48936,Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to versions 2.70.12 2.71.10 and 3.2.2 a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link.

CVE-2024-27050,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()  When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf bpf_xdp_query_opts the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro. This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally which means that programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by libbpf writing out of bounds.  The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS) macro but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency this fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET() macro.,5.5,CWE-787

Impact: Critical – The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user and can arbitrarily add modify and deletefiles and services.  CVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L) nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated but the level of authentication does not matter (PR:L) nor is any user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a full compromised (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H) and compromised devices can be used to pivot into networks that should potentially not be accessible (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power there is a potential safety impact (S:P). This attack can be automated (AU:Y).,8.8,CWE-78

CVE-2024-28255,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-39181, GLPI - Reports plugin for GLPI Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (RXSS). Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser.

URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim the content is executed by the victim's browser.   ,6.1,CWE-79
