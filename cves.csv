CVE-2024-37904,Minder is an open source Software Supply Chain Security Platform. Minder's Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First it sets the `CloneOptions` specifying the url the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem to which it clones and Finally it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack: A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions: 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones 2. Minder does not enforce a size limit to the repository 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-28859,Symfony1 is a community fork of symfony 1.4 with DIC form enhancements latest Swiftmailer better performance composer compatible and PHP 8 support. Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However it is possible to include any object type in `$this->_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.0,CWE-502

CVE-2024-39496,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free due to race with dev replace  While loading a zone's info during creation of a block group we can race with a device replace operation and then trigger a use-after-free on the device that was just replaced (source device of the replace operation).  This happens because at btrfs_load_zone_info() we extract a device from the chunk map into a local variable and then use the device while not under the protection of the device replace rwsem. So if there's a device replace operation happening when we extract the device and that device is the source of the replace operation we will trigger a use-after-free if before we finish using the device the replace operation finishes and frees the device.  Fix this by enlarging the critical section under the protection of the device replace rwsem so that all uses of the device are done inside the critical section.,7.8,CWE-416

Due to the improper URL protocols filtering of links specified in the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations in the application summary component an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with elevated permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user the script will execute with the victim's permissions (up to and including admin).

A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8 and v2.8.12. There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative if upgrading is not possible would be to create a Kubernetes admission controller to reject any resources with an annotation starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the value use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be applied in all clusters managed by ArgoCD.  ,9.0,CWE-79

CVE-2023-24538,Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used since ES6 for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex and themselves can do string interpolation the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. var a = {{.}}) since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1 with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.,9.8,CWE-94
