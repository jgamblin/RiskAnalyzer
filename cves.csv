CVE-2024-49864,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation  In rxrpc_open_socket() it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O thread that will handle it.

CVE-2023-28102,discordrb is an implementation of the Discord API using Ruby. In discordrb before commit `91e13043ffa` the `encoder.rb` file unsafely constructs a shell string using the file parameter which can potentially leave clients of discordrb vulnerable to command injection. The library is not directly exploitable: the exploit requires that some client of the library calls the vulnerable method with user input. However if unsafe input reaches the library method then an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine. Full impact will depend on the permissions of the process running the `discordrb` library and will likely not be total system access. This issue has been addressed in code but a new release of the `discordrb` gem has not been uploaded to rubygems. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2022-094`.,8.3,CWE-78

CVE-2023-39523,ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition analysis with ScanPipe pipelines. Prior to version 32.5.1 the software has a possible command injection vulnerability in the docker fetch process as it allows to append malicious commands in the `docker_reference` parameter.  In the function `scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py:fetch_docker_image` the parameter `docker_reference` is user controllable. The `docker_reference` variable is then passed to the vulnerable function `get_docker_image_platform`.  However the `get_docker_image_plaform` function constructs a shell command with the passed `docker_reference`. The `pipes.run_command` then executes the shell command without any prior sanitization making the function vulnerable to command injections. A malicious user who is able to create or add inputs to a project can inject commands. Although the command injections are blind and the user will not receive direct feedback without logs it is still possible to cause damage to the server/container. The vulnerability appears for example if a malicious user adds a semicolon after the input of `docker://;` it would allow appending malicious commands.  Version 32.5.1 contains a patch for this issue. The `docker_reference` input should be sanitized to avoid command injections and as a workaround one may avoid creating commands with user controlled input directly.,6.8,CWE-77

CVE-2022-23632,Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.6.1 Traefik skips the router transport layer security (TLS) configuration when the host header is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For a request the TLS configuration choice can be different than the router choice which implies the use of a wrong TLS configuration. When sending a request using FQDN handled by a router configured with a dedicated TLS configuration the TLS configuration falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to the configured one. If the CNAME flattening is enabled the selected TLS configuration is the SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value so this can skip the expected TLS configuration. Version 2.6.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround one may add the FDQN to the host rule. However there is no workaround if the CNAME flattening is enabled.,7.4,CWE-295

CVE-2023-25151,opentelemetry-go-contrib is a collection of extensions for OpenTelemetry-Go. The v0.38.0 release of `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` uses the `httpconv.ServerRequest` function to annotate metric measurements for the `http.server.request_content_length` `http.server.response_content_length` and `http.server.duration` instruments. The `ServerRequest` function sets the `http.target` attribute value to be the whole request URI (including the query string)[^1]. The metric instruments do not forget previous measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used this means the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with the unique URIs handled. If the query string is constantly random this will result in a constant increase in memory allocation that can be used in a denial-of-service attack. This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2022-36035,Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories) and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux CLI allows users to deploy Flux components into a Kubernetes cluster via command-line. The vulnerability allows other applications to replace the Flux deployment information with arbitrary content which is deployed into the target Kubernetes cluster instead. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of user-supplied input which results in a path traversal that can be controlled by the attacker. Users sharing the same shell between other applications and the Flux CLI commands could be affected by this vulnerability. In some scenarios no errors may be presented which may cause end users not to realize that something is amiss. A safe workaround is to execute Flux CLI in ephemeral and isolated shell environments which can ensure no persistent values exist from previous processes. However upgrading to the latest version of the CLI is still the recommended mitigation strategy.,7.7,CWE-22
