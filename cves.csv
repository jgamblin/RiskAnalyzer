CVE-2024-24572,facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind. In versions 4.5.0 and earlier the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql variable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.,6.5,CWE-89
CVE-2025-21929,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in hid_ishtp_cl_remove()  During the `rmmod` operation for the `intel_ishtp_hid` driver a use-after-free issue can occur in the hid_ishtp_cl_remove() function. The function hid_ishtp_cl_deinit() is called before ishtp_hid_remove() which can lead to accessing freed memory or resources during the removal process.  Call Trace:  ? ishtp_cl_send+0x168/0x220 [intel_ishtp]  ? hid_output_report+0xe3/0x150 [hid]  hid_ishtp_set_feature+0xb5/0x120 [intel_ishtp_hid]  ishtp_hid_request+0x7b/0xb0 [intel_ishtp_hid]  hid_hw_request+0x1f/0x40 [hid]  sensor_hub_set_feature+0x11f/0x190 [hid_sensor_hub]  _hid_sensor_power_state+0x147/0x1e0 [hid_sensor_trigger]  hid_sensor_runtime_resume+0x22/0x30 [hid_sensor_trigger]  sensor_hub_remove+0xa8/0xe0 [hid_sensor_hub]  hid_device_remove+0x49/0xb0 [hid]  hid_destroy_device+0x6f/0x90 [hid]  ishtp_hid_remove+0x42/0x70 [intel_ishtp_hid]  hid_ishtp_cl_remove+0x6b/0xb0 [intel_ishtp_hid]  ishtp_cl_device_remove+0x4a/0x60 [intel_ishtp]  ...  Additionally ishtp_hid_remove() is a HID level power off which should occur before the ISHTP level disconnect.  This patch resolves the issue by reordering the calls in hid_ishtp_cl_remove().

CVE-2025-54831,Apache Airflow 3 introduced a change to the handling of sensitive information in Connections. The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users effectively applying a write-only model for sensitive values.   In Airflow 3.0.3 this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option.   This issue does not affect Airflow 2.x where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.       Users of Airflow 3.0.3 are advised to upgrade Airflow to >=3.0.4.,6.5,CWE-213
CVE-2023-30546,Contiki-NG is an operating system for Internet of Things devices. An off-by-one error can be triggered in the Antelope database management system in the Contiki-NG operating system in versions 4.8 and prior.

CVE-2023-25558,DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. When the DataHub frontend is configured to authenticate via SSO it will leverage the pac4j library. The processing of the `id_token` is done in an unsafe manner which is not properly accounted for by the DataHub frontend. Specifically if any of the id_token claims value start with the {#sb64} prefix pac4j considers the value to be a serialized Java object and will deserialize it. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the worst case. Although a `RestrictedObjectInputStream` is in place that puts some restriction on what classes can be deserialized it still allows a broad range of java packages and potentially exploitable with different gadget chains.

CVE-2025-47270,nimiq/core-rs-albatross is a Rust implementation of the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol based on the Albatross consensus algorithm. The `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of nimiq/core-rs-albatross is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled memory allocation. Specifically the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer without enforcing an upper bound. Since this length is a `u32` a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0. The patch implements a limit to the discovery message size of 1 MB and also resizes the message buffer size incrementally as the data is read. No known workarounds are available.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2024-26813,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/platform: Create persistent IRQ handlers  The vfio-platform SET_IRQS ioctl currently allows loopback triggering of an interrupt before a signaling eventfd has been configured by the user which thereby allows a NULL pointer dereference.  Rather than register the IRQ relative to a valid trigger register all IRQs in a disabled state in the device open path.  This allows mask operations on the IRQ to nest within the overall enable state governed by a valid eventfd signal.  This decouples @masked protected by the @locked spinlock from @trigger protected via the @igate mutex.  In doing so it's guaranteed that changes to @trigger cannot race the IRQ handlers because the IRQ handler is synchronously disabled before modifying the trigger and loopback triggering of the IRQ via ioctl is safe due to serialization with trigger changes via igate.  For compatibility request_irq() failures are maintained to be local to the SET_IRQS ioctl rather than a fatal error in the open device path. This allows for example a userspace driver with polling mode support to continue to work regardless of moving the request_irq() call site. This necessarily blocks all SET_IRQS access to the failed index.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-25305,Home Assistant Core is an open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0 this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True` which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.1.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.0,CWE-940

CVE-2023-46248,Cody is an artificial intelligence (AI) coding assistant. The Cody AI VSCode extension versions 0.10.0 through 0.14.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution under certain conditions. An attacker in control of a malicious repository could modify the Cody configuration file `.vscode/cody.json` and overwrite Cody commands. If a user with the extension installed opens this malicious repository and runs a Cody command such as /explain or /doc this could allow arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. The vulnerability is rated as critical severity but with low exploitability. It requires the user to have a malicious repository loaded and execute the overwritten command in VS Code. The issue is exploitable regardless of the user blocking code execution on a repository through VS Code Workspace Trust. The issue was found during a regular 3rd party penetration test. The maintainers of Cody do not have evidence of open source repositories having malicious `.vscode/cody.json` files to exploit this vulnerability. The issue is fixed in version 0.14.1 of the Cody VSCode extension. In case users can't promptly upgrade they should not open any untrusted repositories with the Cody extension loaded.,9.0,CWE-15

CVE-2023-0040,Versions of Async HTTP Client prior to 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a form of targeted request manipulation called CRLF injection. This vulnerability was the result of insufficient validation of HTTP header field values before sending them to the network. Users are vulnerable if they pass untrusted data into HTTP header field values without prior sanitisation. Common use-cases here might be to place usernames from a database into HTTP header fields. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject new HTTP header fields or entirely new requests into the data stream. This can cause requests to be understood very differently by the remote server than was intended.

CVE-2024-26710,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB  KASAN is seen to increase stack usage to the point that it was reported to lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).  To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in commit 3e8635fb2e07 (powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with KASAN).  However with a 32KB stack size to begin with the doubling leads to a 64KB stack which causes build errors:   arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)  Although the asm could be reworked in practice a 32KB stack seems sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.  So only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB.,5.5,CWE-770

CVE-2024-37309,CrateDB is a distributed SQL database. A high-risk vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 5.7.2 where the TLS endpoint (port 4200) permits client-initiated renegotiation. In this scenario an attacker can exploit this feature to repeatedly request renegotiation of security parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources resulting in potential server overload and service disruption.

CVE-2022-48713,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix crash with stop filters in single-range mode  Add a check for !buf->single before calling pt_buffer_region_size in a place where a missing check can cause a kernel crash.  Fixes a bug introduced by commit 670638477aed (perf/x86/intel/pt: Opportunistically use single range output mode) which added a support for PT single-range output mode. Since that commit if a PT stop filter range is hit while tracing the kernel will crash because of a null pointer dereference in pt_handle_status due to calling pt_buffer_region_size without a ToPA configured.  The commit which introduced single-range mode guarded almost all uses of the ToPA buffer variables with checks of the buf->single variable but missed the case where tracing was stopped by the PT hardware which happens when execution hits a configured stop filter.  Tested that hitting a stop filter while PT recording successfully records a trace with this patch but crashes without this patch.,5.5,CWE-476
