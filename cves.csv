CVE-2025-64746,Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.13.0 Directus does not properly clean up field-level permissions when a field is deleted. When a field is removed from a collection its reference in the permissions table remains intact. This stale reference creates a security gap: if another field is later created using the same name it inherits the outdated permission entry. This behavior can unintentionally grant roles access to data they should not be able to read or modify. The issue is particularly risky in multi-tenant or production environments where administrators may reuse field names assuming old permissions have been fully cleared. Version 11.13.0 fixes the issue.,4.6,CWE-284

CVE-2016-15022,A vulnerability was found in mosbth cimage up to 0.7.18. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file check_system.php. The manipulation of the argument $_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE'] leads to cross site scripting. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. Upgrading to version 0.7.19 is able to address this issue. The patch is named 401478c8393989836beeddfeac5ce44570af162b.

CVE-2024-37303,Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse before version 1.106 allows by design unauthenticated remote participants to trigger a download and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver to the local media repository. Such content then also becomes available for download from the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that unauthenticated remote adversaries can use this functionality to plant problematic content into the media repository. Synapse 1.106 introduces a partial mitigation in the form of new endpoints which require authentication for media downloads. The unauthenticated endpoints will be frozen in a future release closing the attack vector.,5.3,CWE-306

CVE-2024-1929,Local Root Exploit via Configuration Dictionary  in dnf5daemon-server before 5.1.17 allows a malicious user to impact Confidentiality and Integrity via Configuration Dictionary.  There are issues with the D-Bus interface long before Polkit is invoked. The `org.rpm.dnf.v0.SessionManager.open_session` method takes a key/value map of configuration entries. A sub-entry in this map placed under the config key is another key/value map. The configuration values found in it will be forwarded as configuration overrides to the `libdnf5::Base` configuration.   Practically all libdnf5 configuration aspects can be influenced here. Already when opening the session via D-Bus the libdnf5 will be initialized using these override configuration values. There is no sanity checking of the content of this config map which is untrusted data. It is possible to make the library loading a plug-in shared library under control of an unprivileged user hence achieving root access.   ,7.5,CWE-20

CVE-2023-29020,@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: ['passport' 'session'])` to clear all the session attributes by default preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.,6.5,CWE-352

CVE-2023-30623,`embano1/wip` is a GitHub Action written in Bash. Prior to version 2 the  `embano1/wip` action uses the `github.event.pull_request.title` parameter in an insecure way. The title parameter is used in a run statement - resulting in a command injection vulnerability due to string interpolation. This vulnerability can be triggered by any user on GitHub. They just need to create a pull request with a commit message containing an exploit. (Note that first-time PR requests will not be run - but the attacker can submit a valid PR before submitting an invalid PR). The commit can be genuine but the commit message can be malicious. This can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners and can be used to exfiltrate any secrets used in the CI pipeline including repository tokens. Version 2 has a fix for this issue.,8.8,CWE-77
