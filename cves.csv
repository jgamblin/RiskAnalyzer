CVE-2022-44748,A directory traversal vulnerability in the ZIP archive extraction routines of KNIME Server since 4.3.0 can result in arbitrary files being overwritten on the server's file system. This vulnerability is also known as 'Zip-Slip'.      An attacker can create a KNIME workflow that when being uploaded can overwrite arbitrary files that the operating system user running the KNIME Server process has write access to. The user must be authenticated and have permissions to upload files to KNIME Server.   This can impact data integrity (file contents are changed) or cause errors in other software (vital files being corrupted). It can even lead to remote code execution if executable files are being replaced and subsequently executed by the KNIME Server process user. In all cases the attacker has to know the location of files on the server's file system though.  Note that users that have permissions to upload workflows usually also have permissions to run them on the KNIME Server and can therefore already execute arbitrary code in the context of the KNIME Executor's operating system user.  There is no workaround to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Updates to fixed versions 4.13.6 4.14.3 or 4.15.3 are advised.   ,7.1,CWE-22

CVE-2024-26721,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/dsc: Fix the macro that calculates DSCC_/DSCA_ PPS reg address  Commit bd077259d0a9 (drm/i915/vdsc: Add function to read any PPS register) defines a new macro to calculate the DSC PPS register addresses with PPS number as an input. This macro correctly calculates the addresses till PPS 11 since the addresses increment by 4. So in that case the following macro works correctly to give correct register address:  _MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4)  However after PPS 11 the register address for PPS 12 increments by 12 because of RC Buffer memory allocation in between. Because of this discontinuity in the address space the macro calculates wrong addresses for PPS 12 - 16 resulting into incorrect DSC PPS parameter value read/writes causing DSC corruption.  This fixes it by correcting this macro to add the offset of 12 for PPS >=12.  v3: Add correct paranthesis for pps argument (Jani Nikula)  (cherry picked from commit 6074be620c31dc2ae11af96a1a5ea95580976fb5),5.5,CWE-131

CVE-2024-42467,openHAB a provider of open-source home automation software has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1 the proxy endpoint of openHAB's CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI this JavaScript code will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2024-42018,An issue was discovered in Atos Eviden SMC xScale before 1.6.6. During initialization of nodes some configuration parameters are retrieved from management nodes. These parameters embed credentials whose integrity and confidentiality may be important to the security of the HPC configuration.

CVE-2024-50145,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()  build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.  __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb allocation fails keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case don't process the packets and don't push them up the network stack - they are skipped.  Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.

CVE-2024-31999,@festify/secure-session creates a secure stateless cookie session for Fastify. At the end of the request handling it will encrypt all data in the session with a secret key and attach the ciphertext as a cookie value with the defined cookie name. After that the session on the server side is destroyed. When an encrypted cookie with matching session name is provided with subsequent requests it will decrypt the ciphertext to get the data. The plugin then creates a new session with the data in the ciphertext. Thus theoretically the web instance is still accessing the data from a server-side session but technically that session is generated solely from a user provided cookie (which is assumed to be non-craftable because it is encrypted with a secret key not known to the user). The issue exists in the session removal process. In the delete function of the code when the session is deleted it is marked for deletion. However if an attacker could gain access to the cookie they could keep using it forever. Version 7.3.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround one may include a last update field in the session and treat old sessions as expired.,7.4,CWE-613
