CVE-2022-48784,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destruction  My previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race where the exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced below) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already runs while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking some interfaces as nl_owner_dead.  The race happens because we have two loops here - first we dev_close() all the netdevs and then we destroy them. If we also have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though) then we can find one during the first iteration close it and go to the second iteration -- but then find two and try to destroy also the one we didn't close yet.  Fix this by only iterating once.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2024-32473,Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine Docker Desktop and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. In 26.0.0 IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses and (3) the interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or in the service configuration of a `compose` file.,4.7,CWE-668

CVE-2023-27479,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with view rights can execute arbitrary Groovy Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of UIX parameters. A proof of concept exploit is to log in add an `XWiki.UIExtensionClass` xobject to the user profile page with an Extension Parameters content containing `label={{/html}} {{async async=true cached=false context=doc.reference}}{{groovy}}println(Hello  + from groovy!){{/groovy}}{{/async}}`. Then navigating to `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` (i.e. `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/PanelsCode/ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` where `<xwiki-host>` is the URL of your XWiki installation) should not execute the Groovy script. If it does you will see `Hello from groovy!` displayed on the screen. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11 14.4.7 and 14.10-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade the issue can be fixed by editing the `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` wiki page and making the same modifications  as shown in commit `6de5442f3c`.,9.9,CWE-74

CVE-2024-26846,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-fc: do not wait in vain when unloading module  The module exit path has race between deleting all controllers and freeing 'left over IDs'. To prevent double free a synchronization between nvme_delete_ctrl and ida_destroy has been added by the initial commit.  There is some logic around trying to prevent from hanging forever in wait_for_completion though it does not handling all cases. E.g. blktests is able to reproduce the situation where the module unload hangs forever.  If we completely rely on the cleanup code executed from the nvme_delete_ctrl path all IDs will be freed eventually. This makes calling ida_destroy unnecessary. We only have to ensure that all nvme_delete_ctrl code has been executed before we leave nvme_fc_exit_module. This is done by flushing the nvme_delete_wq workqueue.  While at it remove the unused nvme_fc_wq workqueue too.,4.4,CWE-415

CVE-2025-61330,A hard-coded weak password vulnerability has been discovered in all Magic-branded devices from Chinese network equipment manufacturer H3C. The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded weak password for the root account in the /etc/shadow configuration or even the absence of any password at all. Some of these devices have the Telnet service enabled by default or users can choose to enable the Telnet service in other device management interfaces (e.g. /debug.asp or /debug_telnet.asp). In addition these devices have related interfaces called Virtual Servers which can map the devices to the public network posing the risk of remote attacks. Therefore attackers can obtain the highest root privileges of the devices through the Telnet service using the weak password hardcoded in the firmware (or without a password) and remote attacks are possible.,6.5,CWE-259

CVE-2024-26806,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooks  The ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are not expected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume(). Remove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.  Those helpers have two roles currently:  - They stop/start the queue including dealing with the kworker.  - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It    requires acquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex.  Step one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step two however has two implications:  - A deadlock occurs because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context    where the lock is already taken (in the ->exec_op() callback where    the usage count is incremented).  - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.  Here is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:  spi_mem_exec_op()         ...         spi_mem_access_start()                 mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)          cqspi_exec_mem_op()                 pm_runtime_resume_and_get()                         cqspi_resume()                                 spi_controller_resume()                                         mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)                 ...          spi_mem_access_end()                 mutex_unlock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)         ...,5.5,CWE-667
