CVE,Description,CVSS3_BaseScore,CWE
CVE-2023-20089,A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) feature for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak which could result in an unexpected reload of the device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect error checking when parsing ingress LLDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition when the device unexpectedly reloads. Note: This vulnerability cannot be exploited by transit traffic through the device. The crafted LLDP packet must be targeted to a directly connected interface and the attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). In addition the attack surface for this vulnerability can be reduced by disabling LLDP on interfaces where it is not required.,7.4,CWE-789

CVE-2024-56740,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs/localio: must clear res.replen in nfs_local_read_done  Otherwise memory corruption can occur due to NFSv3 LOCALIO reads leaving garbage in res.replen: - nfs3_read_done() copies that into server->read_hdrsize; from there   nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests. - nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()   which includes it in hdrsize for xdr_init_pages so that rq_rcv_buf   contains a ridiculous len. - This is copied to rq_private_buf and xs_read_stream_request()   eventually passes the kvec to sock_recvmsg() which receives incoming   data into entirely the wrong place.  This is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads when it is made to pivot back to using normal RPC.  This switch back to using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this issue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3 server while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2023-52517,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drain  Previously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to read any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is correct when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the transfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be transferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO still needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure and DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO corrupting any data read. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never adjusted according to DMA progress in DMA mode thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA mode is a bug. Fix corruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode. Also wait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to ensure all data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.,7.0,CWE-362

CVE-2024-47613,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in `gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush` within `gstgdkpixbufdec.c`.

CVE-2024-53259,quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO the kernel would then return a message too large error on sendmsg i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC) the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially this can be done after completion of the handshake thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.,6.5,CWE-345

CVE-2024-28186,FreeScout is an open source help desk and shared inbox built with PHP.  A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the application to users of the application. This issue arises from the application storing complete stack traces of exceptions in its database. The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to users via the `/conversation/ajax-html/send_log?folder_id=&thread_id={id}` endpoint. The stack trace reveals value of parameters including the username and password passed to the `Swift_Transport_Esmtp_Auth_LoginAuthenticator->authenticate()` function. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to SMTP server credentials. With this sensitive information in hand the attacker can potentially send unauthorized emails from the compromised SMTP server posing a severe threat to the confidentiality and integrity of email communications. This could lead to targeted attacks on both the application users and the organization itself compromising the security of email exchange servers. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.124.

CVE-2024-56138,notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature. During the timestamp signature generation the revocation status of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp signature generation notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised intermediate or revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature which would then be accepted and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service scenarios particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.0,CWE-299
