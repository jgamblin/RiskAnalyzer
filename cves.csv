CVE-2023-46249,authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 when the default admin user has been deleted it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set.

CVE-2025-59053,AIRI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence based Grok Companion. In v0.7.2-beta.2 in the `packages/stage-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.vue` path the Markdown content is processed using the useMarkdown composable and the processed HTML is rendered directly into the DOM using v-html. An attacker creates a card file containing malicious HTML/JavaScript then simply processes it using the highlightTagToHtml function (which simply replaces template tags without HTML escaping) and then directly renders it using v-html leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). The project also exposes the Tauri API which can be called from the frontend. The MCP plugin exposes a command execution interface function in `crates/tauri-plugin-mcp/src/lib.rs`. This allows arbitrary command execution. `connect_server` directly passes the user-supplied `command` and `args` parameters to `Command::new(command).args(args)` without any input validation or whitelisting. Thus the previous XSS exploit could achieve command execution through this interface. v0.7.2-beta.3 fixes the issue.,9.6,CWE-94

CVE-2025-29911,CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted AOS frame with an insufficient length. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` specifically during the processing of the Frame Error Control Field (FECF). The affected code attempts to read from the `p_ingest` buffer at indices `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 2` and `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 1` without verifying if `len_ingest` is sufficiently large. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when `len_ingest` is smaller than `max_frame_size`. As of time of publication no known patched versions exist.,9.8,CWE-122

It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. Once the content of the URI is read it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message) thereby exposing the file contents. (CWE-611)          Description          Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.2 including 9.3.x and 8.3.x do not correctly protect Pentaho Data Integration MessageSourceCrawler against out-of-band XML External Entity Reference.          Impact          By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file.

CVE-2025-30202,vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.5.2 and prior to 0.8.5 are vulnerable to denial of service and data exposure via ZeroMQ on multi-node vLLM deployment. In a multi-node vLLM deployment vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.,7.5,CWE-770

Envoy also has a feature which can “hold” (prevent removal) upstream hosts obtained via service discovery until configured active health checking fails. If an attacker controls an upstream host and also controls service discovery of that host (via DNS the EDS API etc.) an attacker can crash Envoy by forcing removal of the host from service discovery and then failing the gRPC health check request. This will crash Envoy via a null pointer dereference. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may disable gRPC health checking and/or replace it with a different health checking type as a mitigation.,5.9,CWE-476

CVE-2024-26678,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section  The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from 32-bit firmware (i.e. CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)  This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the loader and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image to avoid the need for padding it to 4k which is required for sections appearing in the middle of the image.  Unfortunately this violates the PE/COFF spec and even if most EFI loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference implementation) PE loaders do exist that reject such images on the basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner without leaving any gaps.  So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slight padding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling CONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days),5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2024-57876,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/dp_mst: Fix resetting msg rx state after topology removal  If the MST topology is removed during the reception of an MST down reply or MST up request sideband message the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::up_req_recv/down_rep_recv states could be reset from one thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false) racing with the reading/parsing of the message from another thread via drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() or drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(). The race is possible since the reader/parser doesn't hold any lock while accessing the reception state. This in turn can lead to a memory corruption in the reader/parser as described by commit bd2fccac61b4 (drm/dp_mst: Fix MST sideband message body length check).  Fix the above by resetting the message reception state if needed before reading/parsing a message. Another solution would be to hold the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::lock for the whole duration of the message reception/parsing in drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() and drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req() however this would require a bigger change.

CVE-2024-39315,Pomerium is an identity and context-aware access proxy. Prior to version 0.26.1 the Pomerium user info page (at `/.pomerium`) unintentionally included serialized OAuth2 access and ID tokens from the logged-in user's session. These tokens are not intended to be exposed to end users. This issue may be more severe in the presence of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in an upstream application proxied through Pomerium. If an attacker could insert a malicious script onto a web page proxied through Pomerium that script could access these tokens by making a request to the `/.pomerium` endpoint. Upstream applications that authenticate only the ID token may be vulnerable to user impersonation using a token obtained in this manner. Note that an OAuth2 access token or ID token by itself is not sufficient to hijack a user's Pomerium session. Upstream applications should not be vulnerable to user impersonation via these tokens provided the application verifies the Pomerium JWT for each request the connection between Pomerium and the application is secured by mTLS or the connection between Pomerium and the application is otherwise secured at the network layer. The issue is patched in Pomerium v0.26.1. No known workarounds are available.,5.7,CWE-201

CVE-2022-46156,The Synthetic Monitoring Agent for Grafana's Synthetic Monitoring application provides probe functionality and executes network checks for monitoring remote targets. Users running the Synthetic Monitoring agent prior to version 0.12.0 in their local network are impacted. The authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic Monitoring API is exposed through a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to retrieve the Synthetic Monitoring checks created by the user and assigned to the agent identified with that token. The Synthetic Monitoring API will reject connections from already-connected agents so access to the token does not guarantee access to the checks. Version 0.12.0 contains a fix. Users are advised to rotate the agent tokens. After upgrading to version v0.12.0 or later it's recommended that users of distribution packages review the configuration stored in `/etc/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-monitoring-agent.conf` specifically the `API_TOKEN` variable which has been renamed to `SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN`. As a workaround for previous versions it's recommended that users review the agent settings and set the HTTP listening address in a manner that limits the exposure for example localhost or a non-routed network by using the command line parameter `-listen-address` e.g. `-listen-address localhost:4050`.,7.2,CWE-489
