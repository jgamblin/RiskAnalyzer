CVE-2025-30095,VyOS 1.3 through 1.5 (fixed in 1.4.2) or any Debian-based system using dropbear in combination with live-build has the same Dropbear private host keys across different installations. Thus an attacker can conduct active man-in-the-middle attacks against SSH connections if Dropbear is enabled as the SSH daemon. I n VyOS this is not the default configuration for the system SSH daemon but is for the console service. To mitigate this one can run rm -f /etc/dropbear/*key* and/or rm -f /etc/dropbear-initramfs/*key* and then dropbearkey -t rsa -s 4096 -f /etc/dropbear_rsa_host_key and reload the service or reboot the system before using Dropbear as the SSH daemon (this clears out all keys mistakenly built into the release image) or update to the latest version of VyOS 1.4 or 1.5. Note that this vulnerability is not unique to VyOS and may appear in any Debian-based Linux distribution that uses Dropbear in combination with live-build which has a safeguard against this behavior in OpenSSH but no equivalent one for Dropbear.,9.0,CWE-321

CVE-2024-26704,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix double-free of blocks due to wrong extents moved_len  In ext4_move_extents() moved_len is only updated when all moves are successfully executed and only discards orig_inode and donor_inode preallocations when moved_len is not zero. When the loop fails to exit after successfully moving some extents moved_len is not updated and remains at 0 so it does not discard the preallocations.  If the moved extents overlap with the preallocated extents the overlapped extents are freed twice in ext4_mb_release_inode_pa() and ext4_process_freed_data() (as described in commit 94d7c16cbbbd (ext4: Fix double-free of blocks with EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT)) and bb_free is incremented twice. Hence when trim is executed a zero-division bug is triggered in mb_update_avg_fragment_size() because bb_free is not zero and bb_fragments is zero.  Therefore update move_len after each extent move to avoid the issue.,7.8,CWE-415

CVE-2023-28114,`cilium-cli` is the command line interface to install manage and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters running Cilium. Prior to version 0.13.2`cilium-cli` when used to configure cluster mesh functionality can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote clusters. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected by this issue.  Due to an incorrect mount point specification the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that `etcd` cluster.  This issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2. As a workaround one may use Cilium's Helm charts to create their cluster.,4.8,CWE-280

CVE-2022-3602,A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.
