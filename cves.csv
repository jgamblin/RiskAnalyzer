CVE-2022-31075,KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1 1.10.2 and 1.9.4 EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub and that request has a very large body that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory and a body that is larger than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it through authorization only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1 1.10.2 and 1.9.4.

CVE-2023-23614,Pi-hole®'s Web interface (based off of AdminLTE) provides a central location to manage your Pi-hole. Versions 4.0 and above prior to 5.18.3 are vulnerable to Insufficient Session Expiration. Improper use of admin WEBPASSWORD hash as Remember me for 7 days cookie value makes it possible for an attacker to pass the hash to login or reuse a theoretically expired remember me cookie.

CVE-2023-37470,Metabase is an open-source business intelligence and analytics platform. Prior to versions 0.43.7.3 0.44.7.3 0.45.4.3 0.46.6.4 1.43.7.3 1.44.7.3 1.45.4.3 and 1.46.6.4 a vulnerability could potentially allow remote code execution on one's Metabase server. The core issue is that one of the supported data warehouses (an embedded in-memory database H2) exposes a number of ways for a connection string to include code that is then executed by the process running the embedded database. Because Metabase allows users to connect to databases this means that a user supplied string can be used to inject executable code. Metabase allows users to validate their connection string before adding a database (including on setup) and this validation API was the primary vector used as it can be called without validation. Versions 0.43.7.3 0.44.7.3 0.45.4.3 0.46.6.4 1.43.7.3 1.44.7.3 1.45.4.3 and 1.46.6.4 fix this issue by removing the ability of users to add H2 databases entirely. As a workaround it is possible to block these vulnerabilities at the network level by blocking the endpoints `POST /api/database` `PUT /api/database/:id` and `POST /api/setup/validateuntil`. Those who use H2 as a file-based database should migrate to SQLite.,10.0,CWE-94

CVE-2024-12797,Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated because handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode is set.  Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not detected by clients.  RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server and the server likewise enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.  Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result() and those that do and take appropriate action are not affected.  This issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.  The FIPS modules in 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.,6.3,CWE-392

CVE-2022-49501,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usbnet: Run unregister_netdev() before unbind() again  Commit 2c9d6c2b871d (usbnet: run unbind() before unregister_netdev()) sought to fix a use-after-free on disconnect of USB Ethernet adapters.  It turns out that a different fix is necessary to address the issue: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/18b3541e5372bc9b9fc733d422f4e698c089077c.1650177997.git.lukas@wunner.de/  So the commit was not necessary.  The commit made binding and unbinding of USB Ethernet asymmetrical: Before usbnet_probe() first invoked the ->bind() callback and then register_netdev().  usbnet_disconnect() mirrored that by first invoking unregister_netdev() and then ->unbind().  Since the commit the order in usbnet_disconnect() is reversed and no longer mirrors usbnet_probe().  One consequence is that a PHY disconnected (and stopped) in ->unbind() is afterwards stopped once more by unregister_netdev() as it closes the netdev before unregistering.  That necessitates a contortion in ->stop() because the PHY may only be stopped if it hasn't already been disconnected.  Reverting the commit allows making the call to phy_stop() unconditional in ->stop().,7.8,CWE-416
