CVE-2024-26659,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: handle isoc Babble and Buffer Overrun events properly  xHCI 4.9 explicitly forbids assuming that the xHC has released its ownership of a multi-TRB TD when it reports an error on one of the early TRBs. Yet the driver makes such assumption and releases the TD allowing the remaining TRBs to be freed or overwritten by new TDs.  The xHC should also report completion of the final TRB due to its IOC flag being set by us regardless of prior errors. This event cannot be recognized if the TD has already been freed earlier resulting in Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD error message.  Fix this by reusing the logic for processing isoc Transaction Errors. This also handles hosts which fail to report the final completion.  Fix transfer length reporting on Babble errors.

CVE-2022-38152,An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS 1.3 client connects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on its session the server crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs in the second session which is created through TLS session resumption and reuses the initial struct WOLFSSL. If the server reuses the previous session structure (struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL* ssl) on it the next received Client Hello (that resumes the previous session) crashes the server. Note that this bug is only triggered when resuming sessions using TLS session resumption. Only servers that use wolfSSL_clear instead of the recommended SSL_free; SSL_new sequence are affected. Furthermore wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's compatibility layer and is not enabled by default. It is not part of wolfSSL's native API.,7.5,CWE-754

CVE-2023-33953,gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS attacks:  - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser - Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser  The unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred per-input-block in the parser and because that could be unbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop with n selected by the client.  The unbounded memory buffering bugs:  - The header size limit check was behind the string reading code so we needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb. - HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0’s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack parser needed to read all of them before concluding a parse. - gRPC’s metadata overflow check was performed per frame so that the following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc…,7.5,CWE-789

CVE-2023-26044,react/http is an event-driven streaming HTTP client and server implementation for ReactPHP.  Previous versions of ReactPHP's HTTP server component contain a potential DoS vulnerability that can cause high CPU load when processing large HTTP request bodies. This vulnerability has little to no impact on the default configuration but can be exploited when explicitly using the RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with very large settings. This might lead to consuming large amounts of CPU time for processing requests and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate user requests. This issue has been addressed in release 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may keep the request body limited using RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with a sensible value which should mitigate the issue. An infrastructure or DevOps workaround could be to place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any excessive HTTP request bodies. ,5.3,CWE-400

CVE-2023-1314,A vulnerability has been discovered in cloudflared's installer (<= 2023.3.0) for Windows 32-bits devices that allows a local attacker with no administrative permissions to escalate their privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability exists because the MSI installer used by cloudflared relied on a world-writable directory.  An attacker with local access to the device (without Administrator rights) can use symbolic links to trick the MSI installer into deleting files in locations that the attacker would otherwise have no access to. By creating a symlink from the world-writable directory to the target file the attacker can manipulate the MSI installer's repair functionality to delete the target file during the repair process.  Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to delete important system files or replace them with malicious files potentially leading to the affected device being compromised.  The cloudflared client itself is not affected by this vulnerability only the installer for 32-bit Windows devices.  ,7.5,CWE-59

CVE-2023-2512,Prior to version v1.20230419.0 the FormData API implementation was subject to an integer overflow. If a FormData instance contained more than 2^31 elements the forEach() method could end up reading from the wrong location in memory while iterating over elements. This would most likely lead to a segmentation fault but could theoretically allow arbitrary undefined behavior.   In order for the bug to be exploitable the process would need to be able to allocate 160GB of RAM. Due to this the bug was never exploitable on the Cloudflare Workers platform but could theoretically be exploitable on deployments of workerd running on machines with a huge amount of memory. Moreover in order to be remotely exploited an attacker would have to upload a single form-encoded HTTP request of at least tens of gigabytes in size. The application code would then have to use request.formData() to parse the request and formData.forEach() to iterate over this data. Due to these limitations the exploitation likelihood was considered Low.  A fix that addresses this vulnerability has been released in version v1.20230419.0 and users are encouraged to update to the latest version available.   ,6.5,CWE-125

CVE-2025-0677,A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup the grub's UFS module checks the inode's data size to allocate the internal buffer to read the file content however it fails to check if the symlink data size has overflown. When this occurs grub_malloc() may be called with a smaller value than needed. When further reading the data from the disk into the buffer the grub_ufs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the end of the allocated size. An attack can leverage this by crafting a malicious filesystem and as a result it will corrupt data stored in the heap allowing for arbitrary code execution used to by-pass secure boot mechanisms.,6.4,CWE-787

CVE-2022-41894,TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The reference kernel of the `CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE` TensorFlow Lite operator wrongly increments the data_ptr when adding the bias to the result.

CVE-2021-47218,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails  When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init() h->size is left initialized with a non-zero value but the h->htable pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference since the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed hashtab_init() hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called on it. Yet these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.  Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid empty hashtab when the allocation fails.,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2022-34742,The system module has a read/write vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data confidentiality.,7.5,CWE-125
