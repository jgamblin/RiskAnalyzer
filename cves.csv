CVE-2023-37896,Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner. Prior to version 2.9.9 a security issue in the Nuclei project affected users utilizing Nuclei as Go code (SDK) running custom templates. This issue did not affect CLI users. The problem was related to sanitization issues with payload loading in sandbox mode. There was a potential risk with payloads loading in sandbox mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths not being converted to absolute paths before doing the check for `sandbox` flag allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem in certain cases when using Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation.   This issue has been fixed in version 2.9.9. The maintainers have also enabled sandbox by default for filesystem loading. This can be optionally disabled if required. The `-sandbox` option has been deprecated and is now divided into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which is enabled by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which can be enabled by users optionally. The `-lfa` allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system (disabling sandbox effectively) and `-lna` blocks connections to the local/private network.,7.5,CWE-22

CVE-2022-39257,Matrix iOS SDK allows developers to build iOS apps compatible with Matrix. Prior to version 0.23.19 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-ios-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy. The default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19. matrix-ios-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example by showing a warning for such messages). This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.,7.5,CWE-287

CVE-2024-3110,A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that when clicked by the admin send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions escalate privileges to admin or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers by directly clicking on the link.,8.7,CWE-79

CVE-2024-32465,Git is a revision control system. The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository it should not be trusted by default to be safe as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1 2.44.1 2.43.4 2.42.2 2.41.1 2.40.2 and 2.39.4. As a workaround avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained via archives from untrusted sources.,7.3,CWE-22

CVE-2023-45664,stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. A crafted image file can trigger `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` attempt to double-free the out variable. This happens in `stbi__load_gif_main` because when the `layers * stride` value is zero the behavior is implementation defined but common that realloc frees the old memory and returns null pointer. Since it attempts to double-free the memory a few lines below the first “free” the issue can be potentially exploited only in a multi-threaded environment. In the worst case this may lead to code execution.,7.3,CWE-415

CVE-2025-55039,This issue affects Apache Spark versions before  3.4.4 3.5.2 and 4.0.0.    Apache Spark versions before 4.0.0 3.5.2 and 3.4.4 use an insecure default network encryption cipher for RPC communication between nodes.  When spark.network.crypto.enabled is set to true (it is set to false by default) but spark.network.crypto.cipher is not explicitly configured Spark defaults to AES in CTR mode (AES/CTR/NoPadding) which provides encryption without authentication.  This vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to modify encrypted RPC traffic undetected by flipping bits in ciphertext potentially compromising heartbeat messages or application data and affecting the integrity of Spark workflows.   To mitigate this issue users should either configure spark.network.crypto.cipher to AES/GCM/NoPadding to enable authenticated encryption or  enable SSL encryption by setting spark.ssl.enabled to true which provides stronger transport security.,6.5,CWE-326
