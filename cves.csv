CVE-2023-1998,The Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations by calling prctl with PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the speculation feature as well as by using seccomp. We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.  This happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS) the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However with legacy IBRS the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace due to performance reasons which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.,5.6,CWE-1303

CVE-2023-26490,mailcow is a dockerized email package with multiple containers linked in one bridged network. The Sync Job feature - which can be made available to standard users by assigning them the necessary permission - suffers from a shell command injection. A malicious user can abuse this vulnerability to obtain shell access to the Docker container running dovecot. The imapsync Perl script implements all the necessary functionality for this feature including the XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism. This code path creates a shell command to call openssl. However since different parts of the specified user password are included without any validation one can simply execute additional shell commands. Notably the default ACL for a newly-created mailcow account does not include the necessary permission. The Issue has been fixed within the 2023-03 Update (March 3rd 2023). As a temporary workaround the Syncjob ACL can be removed from all mailbox users preventing from creating or changing existing Syncjobs.,7.3,CWE-78

A write_lock(&pointers_lock) => read_lock(&pointers_lock) deadlock bug and a sb_bread() with write_lock(&pointers_lock) bug were introduced by Replace BKL for chain locking with sysvfs-private rwlock in Linux 2.5.12.  Then [PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix in Linux 2.6.8 fixed the former bug by moving pointers_lock lock to the callers but instead introduced a sb_bread() with read_lock(&pointers_lock) bug (which made this problem easier to hit).  Al Viro suggested that why not to do like get_branch()/get_block()/ find_shared() in Minix filesystem does. And doing like that is almost a revert of [PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix except that get_branch()  from with find_shared() is called without write_lock(&pointers_lock).,5.3,CWE-667

CVE-2022-41948,DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture management validation analytics and visualization. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A DHIS2 user with authority to manage users can assign superuser privileges to themself by manually crafting an HTTP PUT request. Only users with the following DHIS2 user role authorities can exploit this vulnerability. Note that in many systems the only users with user admin privileges are also superusers. In these cases the escalation vulnerability does not exist. The vulnerability is only exploitable by attackers who can authenticate as users with the user admin authority.  As this is usually a small and relatively trusted set of users exploit vectors will often be limited. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1 2.37.8.1 2.38.2.1 2.39.0.1. The only known workaround to this issue is to avoid the assignment of the user management authority to any users until the patch has been applied.,6.7,CWE-269
