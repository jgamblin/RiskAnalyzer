CVE-2022-23521,Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanism to allow defining attributes for paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns a huge number of attributes for a single pattern or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file but not when parsing them from the index. Consequentially the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree the index or both. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes which may result in remote code execution.

CVE-2024-24814,mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified™ authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer like 99999999 the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2025-66291,OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0 to 5.7 the interview attachment retrieval endpoint in the Recruitment module serves files based solely on an authenticated session and user-supplied identifiers without verifying whether the requester has permission to access the associated interview record. Because the server does not perform any recruitment-level authorization checks an ESS-level user with no access to recruitment workflows can directly request interview attachment URLs and receive the corresponding files. This exposes confidential interview documents—including candidate CVs evaluations and supporting files—to unauthorized users. The issue arises from relying on predictable object identifiers and session presence rather than validating the user’s association with the relevant recruitment process. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.,4.3,CWE-200

CVE-2022-3924,This issue can affect BIND 9 resolvers with `stale-answer-enable yes;` that also make use of the option `stale-answer-client-timeout` configured with a value greater than zero.  If the resolver receives many queries that require recursion there will be a corresponding increase in the number of clients that are waiting for recursion to complete. If there are sufficient clients already waiting when a new client query is received so that it is necessary to SERVFAIL the longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM `recursive-clients` limit and soft quota) then it is possible for a race to occur between providing a stale answer to this older client and sending an early timeout SERVFAIL which may cause an assertion failure. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36 9.18.0 through 9.18.10 9.19.0 through 9.19.8 and 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.,7.5,CWE-617

CVE-2025-23208,zot is a production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry. The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so group revocations/removals are ignored in the API. SetUserGroups is alled on login but instead of replacing the group memberships they are appended. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file but that wasn't obvious to me if it were the case. Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.3,CWE-269

CVE-2021-46921,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()  While this code is executed with the wait_lock held a reader can acquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire() but only truly acquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed successfully which isn’t ordered. This exposes the window between the acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads following the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before the write lock is truly acquired.  We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while holding the read lock but the writer can see a value change out from under it.

CVE-2021-47119,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super  Buffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev(); otherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not be freed by kill_bdev and subsequently that bh will be leaked.  If blocksizes differ sb_set_blocksize() will kill current buffers and page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread again but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't fully free superblock page and buffer head and being busy they were not freed and instead leaked.  This can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:    systemctl start <ext4_on_lvm>.mount and   systemctl stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount  ... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts and the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never gets freed and memory consumption is much more easily noticed.,5.5,CWE-401
