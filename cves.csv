CVE-2024-46683,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fence  The fence lock is part of the queue therefore in the current design anything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to prevent the queue from being freed.  However currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the queue ref but if something is waiting on the fence the waiter is kicked to wake up at some later point where upon waking up it first grabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have already dropped the queue ref then the lock might already be freed as part of the queue leading to uaf.  To prevent this move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't run into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level lock or only release the queue in the fence release callback however that might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.

CVE-2024-32888,The Amazon JDBC Driver for Redshift is a Type 4 JDBC driver that provides database connectivity through the standard JDBC application program interfaces (APIs) available in the Java Platform Enterprise Editions. Prior to version 2.1.0.28 SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value. There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default extended query mode.

Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected. This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28. As a workaround do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`.

CVE-2024-51748,Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. An authenticated Kanboard admin can run arbitrary php code on the server in combination with a file write possibility. The user interface language is determined and loaded by the setting `application_language` in the `settings` table. Thus an attacker who can upload a modified sqlite.db through the dedicated feature has control over the filepath which is loaded. Exploiting this vulnerability has one constraint: the attacker must be able to place a file (called translations.php) on the system. However this is not impossible think of anonymous FTP server or another application that allows uploading files. Once the attacker has placed its file with the actual php code as the payload the attacker can craft a sqlite db settings which uses path traversal to point to the directory where the `translations.php` file is stored. Then gaining code execution after importing the crafted sqlite.db. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.42 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,9.1,CWE-22

CVE-2023-37467,Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.1.0.beta7 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches a CSP (Content Security Policy) nonce reuse vulnerability was discovered could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to bypass CSP protection for anonymous (i.e. unauthenticated) users.

CVE-2024-53259,quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO the kernel would then return a message too large error on sendmsg i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC) the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially this can be done after completion of the handshake thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.,6.5,CWE-345
CVE-2022-31092,Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. Pimcore offers developers listing classes to make querying data easier.

The actual issue is that quoting is not done properly in both cases so there's the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the listing classes. This issue has been resolved in version 10.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade or to apple the patch manually. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,7.5,CWE-89

CVE-2022-35924,NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.comvictim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.comvictim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(@victim.com)` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade you can normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization.,9.1,CWE-20

CVE-2025-24028,Joplin is a free open source note taking and to-do application which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by differences between how Joplin's HTML sanitizer handles comments and how the browser handles comments. This affects both the Rich Text Editor and the Markdown viewer. However unlike the Rich Text Editor the Markdown viewer is `cross-origin isolated` which prevents JavaScript from directly accessing functions/variables in the toplevel Joplin `window`. This issue is not present in Joplin 3.1.24 and may have been introduced in `9b50539`. This is an XSS vulnerability that impacts users that open untrusted notes in the Rich Text Editor. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.2.12 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.8,CWE-79

CVE-2025-23038,WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `remuneracao.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `remuneracao.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6.
