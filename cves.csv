CVE-2024-49982,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places  For fixing CVE-2023-6270 f98364e92662 (aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts) makes tx() calling dev_put() instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs into use-after-free.  Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate() aoecmd_ata_rw() resend() probe() and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the refcnt of skb->dev.  On the other hand moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of skb->dev be reduced to a negative value because corresponding dev_hold() are not called in revalidate() aoecmd_ata_rw() resend() probe() and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). This patch fixed this issue.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2025-25296,Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0 Label Studio's `/projects/upload-example` endpoint allows injection of arbitrary HTML through a `GET` request with an appropriately crafted `label_config` query parameter. By crafting a specially formatted XML label config with inline task data containing malicious HTML/JavaScript an attacker can achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). While the application has a Content Security Policy (CSP) it is only set in report-only mode making it ineffective at preventing script execution. The vulnerability exists because the upload-example endpoint renders user-provided HTML content without proper sanitization on a GET request. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers by getting them to visit a maliciously crafted URL. This is considered vulnerable because it enables attackers to execute JavaScript in victims' contexts potentially allowing theft of sensitive data session hijacking or other malicious actions. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2024-40631,Plate media is an open source rich-text editor for React. Editors that use `MediaEmbedElement` and pass custom `urlParsers` to the `useMediaState` hook may be vulnerable to XSS if a custom parser allows `javascript:` `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be embedded. Editors that do not use `urlParsers` and consume the `url` property directly may also be vulnerable if the URL is not sanitised. The default parsers `parseTwitterUrl` and `parseVideoUrl` are not affected. `@udecode/plate-media` 36.0.10 resolves this issue by only allowing HTTP and HTTPS URLs during parsing. This affects only the `embed` property returned from `useMediaState`. In addition the `url` property returned from `useMediaState` has been renamed to `unsafeUrl` to indicate that it has not been sanitised. The `url` property on `element` is also unsafe but has not been renamed. If you're using either of these properties directly you will still need to validate the URL yourself. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any custom `urlParsers` do not allow `javascript:` `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be returned in the `url` property of their return values. If `url` is consumed directly validate the URL protocol before passing it to the `iframe` element.  ,8.1,CWE-79

CVE-2021-47646,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert Revert block bfq: honor already-setup queue merges  A crash [1] happened to be triggered in conjunction with commit 2d52c58b9c9b (block bfq: honor already-setup queue merges). The latter was then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17 (Revert block bfq: honor already-setup queue merges). Yet the reverted commit was not the one introducing the bug. In fact it actually triggered a UAF introduced by a different commit and now fixed by commit d29bd41428cf (block bfq: reset last_bfqq_created on group change).  So there is no point in keeping commit 2d52c58b9c9b (block bfq: honor already-setup queue merges) out. This commit restores it.  [1] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214503,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-28116,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In versions 4.8 and prior an out-of-bounds write can occur in the BLE L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG operating system.  The network stack of Contiki-NG uses a global buffer (packetbuf) for processing of packets with the size of PACKETBUF_SIZE. In particular when using the BLE L2CAP module with the default configuration the PACKETBUF_SIZE value becomes larger then the actual size of the packetbuf.  When large packets are processed by the L2CAP module a buffer overflow can therefore occur when copying the packet data to the packetbuf. The vulnerability has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be worked around by applying the patch manually.,8.1,CWE-120

CVE-2024-26789,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: arm64/neonbs - fix out-of-bounds access on short input  The bit-sliced implementation of AES-CTR operates on blocks of 128 bytes and will fall back to the plain NEON version for tail blocks or inputs that are shorter than 128 bytes to begin with.  It will call straight into the plain NEON asm helper which performs all memory accesses in granules of 16 bytes (the size of a NEON register). For this reason the associated plain NEON glue code will copy inputs shorter than 16 bytes into a temporary buffer given that this is a rare occurrence and it is not worth the effort to work around this in the asm code.  The fallback from the bit-sliced NEON version fails to take this into account potentially resulting in out-of-bounds accesses. So clone the same workaround and use a temp buffer for short in/outputs.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2024-42368,OpenTelemetry also known as OTel is a vendor-neutral open source Observability framework for instrumenting generating collecting and exporting telemetry data such as traces metrics and logs. The bearertokenauth extension's server authenticator performs a simple non-constant time string comparison of the received & configured bearer tokens. This impacts anyone using the `bearertokenauth` server authenticator. Malicious clients with network access to the collector may perform a timing attack against a collector with this authenticator to guess the configured token by iteratively sending tokens and comparing the response time. This would allow an attacker to introduce fabricated or bad data into the collector's telemetry pipeline. The observable timing vulnerability was fixed by using constant-time comparison in  0.107.0,6.5,CWE-208

CVE-2021-47281,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()  The timer instance per queue is exclusive and snd_seq_timer_open() should have managed the concurrent accesses.  It looks as if it's checking the already existing timer instance at the beginning but it's not right because there is no protection hence any later concurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timer instance easily.  This may result in UAF as the leftover timer instance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed as spotted by syzkaller recently.  For avoiding the race add a proper check at the assignment of tmr->timeri again and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.,7.0,CWE-416

CVE-2024-34347,@hoppscotch/cli is a CLI to run Hoppscotch Test Scripts in CI environments. Prior to 0.8.0 the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code.
