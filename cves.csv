CVE-2025-21751,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: HWS change error flow on matcher disconnect  Currently when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns an error which continues running the calling function and eventually frees the matcher that is being disconnected. This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.  This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when some FW command fails during disconnect.  Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this problem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection between matchers) and will also lead to resource leakage as it is the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.  However the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash the machine with use-after-free error.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2025-32971,XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 4.5.1 to before 15.10.13 from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.4 and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1 the Solr script service doesn't take dropped programming rights into account. The Solr script service that is accessible in XWiki's scripting API normally requires programming rights to be called. Due to using the wrong API for checking rights it doesn't take the fact into account that programming rights might have been dropped by calling `$xcontext.dropPermissions()`. If some code relies on this for the safety of executing Velocity code with the wrong author context this could allow a user with script rights to either cause a high load by indexing documents or to temporarily remove documents from the search index. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.13 16.4.4 and 16.8.0-rc-1.,3.8,CWE-863

CVE-2024-45313,Overleaf is a web-based collaborative LaTeX editor. When installing Server Pro using the Overleaf Toolkit from before 2024-07-17 or legacy docker-compose.yml from before 2024-08-28 the configuration for LaTeX compiles was insecure by default requiring the administrator to enable the security features via a configuration setting (`SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED` in Toolkit `SANDBOXED_COMPILES` in legacy docker-compose/custom deployments). If these security features are not enabled then users have access to the `sharelatex` container resources (filesystem network environment variables) when running compiles leading to multiple file access vulnerabilities either directly or via symlinks created during compiles. The setting has now been changed to be secure by default for new installs in the Toolkit and legacy docker-compose deployment. The Overleaf Toolkit has been updated to set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` by default for new installs. It is recommended that any existing installations using the previous default setting migrate to using sibling containers.

CVE-2023-31137,MaraDNS is open-source software that implements the Domain Name System (DNS). In version 3.5.0024 and prior a remotely exploitable integer underflow vulnerability in the DNS packet decompression function allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an abnormal program termination.  The vulnerability exists in the `decomp_get_rddata` function within the `Decompress.c` file. When handling a DNS packet with an Answer RR of qtype 16 (TXT record) and any qclass if the `rdlength` is smaller than `rdata` the result of the line `Decompress.c:886` is a negative number `len = rdlength - total;`. This value is then passed to the `decomp_append_bytes` function without proper validation causing the program to attempt to allocate a massive chunk of memory that is impossible to allocate. Consequently the program exits with an error code of 64 causing a Denial of Service.  One proposed fix for this vulnerability is to patch `Decompress.c:887` by breaking `if(len <= 0)` which has been incorporated in version 3.5.0036 via commit bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58.,7.5,CWE-191

CVE-2025-37951,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/v3d: Add job to pending list if the reset was skipped  When a CL/CSD job times out we check if the GPU has made any progress since the last timeout. If so instead of resetting the hardware we skip the reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs a chance to complete.  However when `timedout_job()` is called the job in question is removed from the pending list which means it won't be automatically freed through `free_job()`. Consequently when we skip the reset and keep the job running the job won't be freed when it finally completes.  This situation leads to a memory leak as exposed in [1] and [2].  Similarly to commit 704d3d60fec4 (drm/etnaviv: don't block scheduler when GPU is still active) this patch ensures the job is put back on the pending list when extending the timeout.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2023-37901,Indico is an open source a general-purpose web based event management tool. There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting content from Indico. Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content. Considering that event organizers may want to delete suspicious-looking content when spotting it there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased when combined with some some social engineering pointing the victim towards this content. Users need to update to Indico 3.2.6 as soon as possible. See the docs for instructions on how to update. Users who cannot upgrade should only let trustworthy users manage categories create events or upload materials (submission privileges on a contribution/event). This should already be the case in a properly-configured setup when it comes to category/event management.

CVE-2023-24816,IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.,4.5,CWE-20

CVE-2022-48807,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler  Currently the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO LAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This is causing a problem though since the netdev_notifier_info passed has a different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problem manifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.  Fix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only is passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.  Also included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev and related braces.,5.5,CWE-908
