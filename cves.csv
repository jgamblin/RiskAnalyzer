CVE-2022-36078,Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.,8.8,CWE-789

CVE-2023-28628,lambdaisland/uri is a pure Clojure/ClojureScript URI library. In versions prior to 1.14.120 `authority-regex` allows an attacker to send malicious URLs to be parsed by the `lambdaisland/uri` and return the wrong authority. This issue is similar to but distinct from CVE-2020-8910.

CVE-2023-41331,SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. Versions prior to 5.11.0 are vulnerable to remote command execution. Through a carefully crafted payload an attacker can achieve JNDI injection or system command execution. In the default configuration of the SOFARPC framework a blacklist is used to filter out dangerous classes encountered during the deserialization process. However the blacklist is not comprehensive and an actor can exploit certain native JDK classes and common third-party packages to construct gadget chains capable of achieving JNDI injection or system command execution attacks. Version 5.11.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround users can add `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat` to the blacklist.,9.8,CWE-917

CVE-2024-46676,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: pn533: Add poll mod list filling check  In case of im_protocols value is 1 and tm_protocols value is 0 this combination successfully passes the check 'if (!im_protocols && !tm_protocols)' in the nfc_start_poll(). But then after pn533_poll_create_mod_list() call in pn533_start_poll() poll mod list will remain empty and dev->poll_mod_count will remain 0 which lead to division by zero.  Normally no im protocol has value 1 in the mask so this combination is not expected by driver. But these protocol values actually come from userspace via Netlink interface (NFC_CMD_START_POLL operation). So a broken or malicious program may pass a message containing a bad combination of protocol parameter values so that dev->poll_mod_count is not incremented inside pn533_poll_create_mod_list() thus leading to division by zero. Call trace looks like: nfc_genl_start_poll()   nfc_start_poll()     ->start_poll()     pn533_start_poll()  Add poll mod list filling check.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.,5.5,CWE-369

CVE-2021-47183,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference  If an FC link down transition while PLOGIs are outstanding to fabric well known addresses outstanding ABTS requests may result in a NULL pointer dereference. Driver unload requests may hang with repeated 2878 log messages.  The Link down processing results in ABTS requests for outstanding ELS requests. The Abort WQEs are sent for the ELSs before the driver had set the link state to down. Thus the driver is sending the Abort with the expectation that an ABTS will be sent on the wire. The Abort request is stalled waiting for the link to come up. In some conditions the driver may auto-complete the ELSs thus if the link does come up the Abort completions may reference an invalid structure.  Fix by ensuring that Abort set the flag to avoid link traffic if issued due to conditions where the link failed.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-24806,libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`) truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001` which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.3,CWE-918

CVE-2024-35827,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()  The controllen variable is type size_t (unsigned long).  Casting it to int could lead to an integer underflow.  The check_add_overflow() function considers the type of the destination which is type int.  If we add two positive values and the result cannot fit in an integer then that's counted as an overflow.  However if we cast controllen to an int and it turns negative then negative values *can* fit into an int type so there is no overflow.  Good: 100 + (unsigned long)-4 = 96  <-- overflow  Bad: 100 + (int)-4 = 96 <-- no overflow  I deleted the cast of the sizeof() as well.  That's not a bug but the cast is unnecessary.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2025-24359,ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6 if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.,8.4,CWE-134
