CVE-2023-27484,crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. In affected versions an already highly privileged user able to create or update Compositions can specify an arbitrarily high index in a patch's `ToFieldPath` which could lead to excessive memory usage once such Composition is selected for a Composite resource. Compositions allow users to specify patches inserting elements into arrays at an arbitrary index. When a Composition is selected for a Composite Resource patches are evaluated and if a specified index is greater than the current size of the target slice Crossplane will grow that slice up to the specified index which could lead to an excessive amount of memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed. The index is already capped to the maximum value for a uint32 (4294967295) when parsed but that is still an unnecessarily large value. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.11.2 1.10.3 and 1.9.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can restrict write privileges on Compositions to only admin users as a workaround.,6.2,CWE-20

CVE-2024-46683,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fence  The fence lock is part of the queue therefore in the current design anything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to prevent the queue from being freed.  However currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the queue ref but if something is waiting on the fence the waiter is kicked to wake up at some later point where upon waking up it first grabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have already dropped the queue ref then the lock might already be freed as part of the queue leading to uaf.  To prevent this move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't run into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level lock or only release the queue in the fence release callback however that might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.

CVE-2024-47606,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result only 0x89 bytes are allocated despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally during the call to gst_memory_unmap the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.,9.8,CWE-190

CVE-2022-26612,In Apache Hadoop The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows.

CVE-2021-47205,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbinding  Currently unbinding a CCU driver unmaps the device's MMIO region while leaving its clocks/resets and their providers registered. This can cause a page fault later when some clock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fix this by separating the CCU initialization from the memory allocation and then using a devres callback to unregister the clocks and resets.  This also fixes a memory leak of the `struct ccu_reset` and uses the correct owner (the specific platform driver) for the clocks and resets.  Early OF clock providers are never unregistered and limited error handling is possible so they are mostly unchanged. The error reporting is made more consistent by moving the message inside of_sunxi_ccu_probe.,5.5,CWE-401

However if device_add() succeeds some resource (like struct device_private allocated by device_private_init()) is not released by device_del().  Therefore after device_add() succeeds by gcdev_register() it needs to call put_device() to release resource in the error handle path.  Here we move forward the register of release function and let it release every piece of resource by put_device() instead of kfree().  While at it fix another subtle issue i.e. when gc->ngpio is equal to 0 we still call kcalloc() and in case of further error kfree() on the ZERO_PTR pointer which is not NULL. It's not a bug per se but rather waste of the resources and potentially wrong expectation about contents of the gdev->descs variable.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2023-24816,IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available.
