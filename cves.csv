CVE-2026-22685,DevToys is a desktop app for developers. In versions from 2.0.0.0 to before 2.0.9.0 a path traversal vulnerability exists in the DevToys extension installation mechanism. When processing extension packages (NUPKG archives) DevToys does not sufficiently validate file paths contained within the archive. A malicious extension package could include crafted file entries such as ../../…/target-file causing the extraction process to write files outside the intended extensions directory. This flaw enables an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the user’s system with the privileges of the DevToys process. Depending on the environment this may lead to code execution configuration tampering or corruption of application or system files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.9.0.,8.8,CWE-22
CVE-2024-49913,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add null check for top_pipe_to_program in commit_planes_for_stream  This commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in the `commit_planes_for_stream` function at line 4140. The issue could occur when `top_pipe_to_program` is null.  The fix adds a check to ensure `top_pipe_to_program` is not null before accessing its stream_res. This prevents a null pointer dereference.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc.c:4140 commit_planes_for_stream() error: we previously assumed 'top_pipe_to_program' could be null (see line 3906),5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-53259,quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO the kernel would then return a message too large error on sendmsg i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC) the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially this can be done after completion of the handshake thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.,6.5,CWE-345
CVE-2024-40951,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: fix NULL pointer dereference in ocfs2_abort_trigger()  bdev->bd_super has been removed and commit 8887b94d9322 change the usage from bdev->bd_super to b_assoc_map->host->i_sb.  Since ocfs2 hasn't set bh->b_assoc_map it will trigger NULL pointer dereference when calling into ocfs2_abort_trigger().  Actually this was pointed out in history see commit 74e364ad1b13.  But I've made a mistake when reviewing commit 8887b94d9322 and then re-introduce this regression.  Since we cannot revive bdev in buffer head so fix this issue by initializing all types of ocfs2 triggers when fill super and then get the specific ocfs2 trigger from ocfs2_caching_info when access journal.

CVE-2025-59050,Greenshot is an open source Windows screenshot utility. Greenshot 1.3.300 and earlier deserializes attacker-controlled data received in a WM_COPYDATA message using BinaryFormatter.Deserialize without prior validation or authentication allowing a local process at the same integrity level to trigger arbitrary code execution inside the Greenshot process. The vulnerable logic resides in a WinForms WndProc handler for WM_COPYDATA (message 74) that copies the supplied bytes into a MemoryStream and invokes BinaryFormatter.Deserialize and only afterward checks whether the specified channel is authorized. Because the authorization check occurs after deserialization any gadget chain embedded in the serialized payload executes regardless of channel membership. A local attacker who can send WM_COPYDATA to the Greenshot main window can achieve in-process code execution which may aid evasion of application control policies by running payloads within the trusted signed Greenshot.exe process. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.301. No known workarounds exist.,8.4,CWE-502
