CVE-2023-51443,FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.11 when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup FreeSWITCH is susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol. This attack can be done continuously thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack. If an attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with an invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to the port on the FreeSWITCH server that is expecting packets from the caller a DTLS error is generated. This results in the media session being torn down which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable FreeSWITCH servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. To address this vulnerability upgrade FreeSWITCH to 1.10.11 which includes the security fix. The solution implemented is to drop all packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.,7.5,CWE-703

CVE-2022-50288,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  qlcnic: prevent ->dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure  adapter->dcb would get silently freed inside qlcnic_dcb_enable() in case qlcnic_dcb_attach() would return an error which always happens under OOM conditions. This would lead to use-after-free because both of the existing callers invoke qlcnic_dcb_get_info() on the obtained pointer which is potentially freed at that point.  Propagate errors from qlcnic_dcb_enable() and instead free the dcb pointer at callsite using qlcnic_dcb_free(). This also removes the now unused qlcnic_clear_dcb_ops() helper which was a simple wrapper around kfree() also causing memory leaks for partially initialized dcb.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static analysis tool.,5.5,CWE-416

CVE-2022-39260,Git is an open source scalable distributed revision control system. `git shell` is a restricted login shell that can be used to implement Git's push/pull functionality via SSH. In versions prior to 2.30.6 2.31.5 2.32.4 2.33.5 2.34.5 2.35.5 2.36.3 and 2.37.4 the function that splits the command arguments into an array improperly uses an `int` to represent the number of entries in the array allowing a malicious actor to intentionally overflow the return value leading to arbitrary heap writes.

CVE-2022-48809,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata  When uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata a new dst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb. This is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specific skb.  The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of 1 which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. When tun_dst_unclone returns the dst+metadata is only referenced from a single place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never drop to 0 (when the skb is consumed) leading to a memory leak.  Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone as the dst+metadata refcount is already 1.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2025-59433,Conventional Changelog generates changelogs and release notes from a project's commit messages and metadata. Prior to version 2.0.0 @conventional-changelog/git-client has an argument injection vulnerability. This vulnerability manifests with the library's getTags() API which allows extra parameters to be passed to the git log command. In another API by this library getRawCommits() there are secure practices taken to ensure that the extra parameter path is unable to inject an argument by ending the git log command with the special shell syntax --. However the library does not follow the same practice for getTags() as it does not attempt to sanitize for user input validate the given params or restrict them to an allow list. Nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (--) to communicate the end of options. Thus allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the --output= command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.,5.3,CWE-88

CVE-2023-40021,Oppia is an online learning platform. When comparing a received CSRF token against the expected token Oppia uses the string equality operator (`==`) which is not safe against timing attacks. By repeatedly submitting invalid tokens an attacker can brute-force the expected CSRF token character by character. Once they have recovered the token they can then submit a forged request on behalf of a logged-in user and execute privileged actions on that user's behalf. In particular the function to validate received CSRF tokens is at `oppia.core.controllers.base.CsrfTokenManager.is_csrf_token_valid`. An attacker who can lure a logged-in Oppia user to a malicious website can perform any change on Oppia that the user is authorized to do including changing profile information; creating deleting and changing explorations; etc. Note that the attacker cannot change a user's login credentials. An attack would need to complete within 1 second because every second the time used in computing the token changes. This issue has been addressed in commit `b89bf80837` which has been included in release `3.3.2-hotfix-2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.3,CWE-203

Fix it by introducing x86 specific function arch_kimage_file_post_load_cleanup() and freeing the buffer there.  And also remove the incorrect elf header buffer freeing code.  Before calling arch specific kexec_file loading function the image instance has been initialized.  So 'image->elf_headers' must be NULL.  It doesn't make sense to free the elf header buffer in the place.  Three different people have reported three bugs about the memory leak on x86_64 inside Redhat.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2023-53200,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: x_tables: fix percpu counter block leak on error path when creating new netns  Here is the stack where we allocate percpu counter block:    +-< __alloc_percpu     +-< xt_percpu_counter_alloc       +-< find_check_entry # {arpipip6}_tables.c         +-< translate_table  And it can be leaked on this code path:    +-> ip6t_register_table     +-> translate_table # allocates percpu counter block     +-> xt_register_table # fails  there is no freeing of the counter block on xt_register_table fail. Note: xt_percpu_counter_free should be called to free it like we do in do_replace through cleanup_entry helper (or in __ip6t_unregister_table).  Probability of hitting this error path is low AFAICS (xt_register_table can only return ENOMEM here as it is not replacing anything as we are creating new netns and it is hard to imagine that all previous allocations succeeded and after that one in xt_register_table failed). But it's worth fixing even the rare leak.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2025-66471,urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Starting in version 1.0 and prior to 2.6.0 the Streaming API improperly handles highly compressed data. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. When streaming a compressed response urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP Content-Encoding header (e.g. gzip deflate br or zstd). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation. The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data.,7.5,CWE-409
