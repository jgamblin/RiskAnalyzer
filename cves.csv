CVE-2023-50260,Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention detection and response. A wrong validation in the `host_deny` script allows to write any string in the `hosts.deny` file which can end in an arbitrary command execution on the target system. This vulnerability is part of the active response feature which can automatically triggers actions in response to alerts. By default active responses are limited to a set of pre defined executables. This is enforced by only allowing executables stored under `/var/ossec/active-response/bin` to be run as an active response. However the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/host_deny` can be exploited. `host_deny` is used to add IP address to the `/etc/hosts.deny` file to block incoming connections on a service level by using TCP wrappers. Attacker can inject arbitrary command into the `/etc/hosts.deny` file and execute arbitrary command by using the spawn directive. The active response can be triggered by writing events either to the local `execd` queue on server or to the `ar` queue which forwards the events to agents. So it can leads to LPE on server as root and RCE on agent as root. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.2.,8.8,CWE-94

CVE-2025-49581,XWiki is a generic wiki platform. Any user with edit right on a page (could be the user's profile) can execute code (Groovy Python Velocity) with programming right by defining a wiki macro. This allows full access to the whole XWiki installation. The main problem is that if a wiki macro parameter allows wiki syntax its default value is executed with the rights of the author of the document where it is used. This can be exploited by overriding a macro like the children macro that is used in a page that has programming right like the page XWiki.ChildrenMacro and thus allows arbitrary script macros. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.4.7 16.10.3 and 17.0.0 by executing wiki parameters with the rights of the wiki macro's author when the parameter's value is the default value.,8.8,CWE-94

CVE-2025-52573,iOS Simulator MCP Server (ios-simulator-mcp) is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with iOS simulators. Versions prior to 1.3.3 are written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation. The MCP Server exposes the tool `ui_tap` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input. LLM exposed user input for `duration` `udid` and `x` and `y` args can be replaced with shell meta-characters like `;` or `&&` or others to change the behavior from running the expected command `idb` to another command. When LLMs are tricked through prompt injection (and other techniques and attack vectors) to call the tool with input that uses special shell characters such as `; rm -rf /tmp;#` and other payload variations the full command-line text will be interepted by the shell and result in other commands except of `ps` executing on the host running the MCP Server. Version 1.3.3 contains a patch for the issue.,6.0,CWE-78
CVE-2022-49209,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf sockmap: Fix memleak in tcp_bpf_sendmsg while sk msg is full  If tcp_bpf_sendmsg() is running while sk msg is full.

If partial memory has been alloced by sk_msg_alloc() that is msg_tx->sg.size is greater than osize after sk_msg_alloc() memleak occurs. To fix we use sk_msg_trim() to release the allocated memory then goto wait for memory.  Other call paths of sk_msg_alloc() have the similar issue such as tls_sw_sendmsg() so handle sk_msg_trim logic inside sk_msg_alloc() as Cong Wang suggested.

CVE-2022-49219,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/pci: fix memory leak during D3hot to D0 transition  If 'vfio_pci_core_device::needs_pm_restore' is set (PCI device does not have No_Soft_Reset bit set in its PMCSR config register) then the current PCI state will be saved locally in 'vfio_pci_core_device::pm_save' during D0->D3hot transition and same will be restored back during D3hot->D0 transition. For saving the PCI state locally pci_store_saved_state() is being used and the pci_load_and_free_saved_state() will free the allocated memory.  But for reset related IOCTLs vfio driver calls PCI reset-related API's which will internally change the PCI power state back to D0. So when the guest resumes then it will get the current state as D0 and it will skip the call to vfio_pci_set_power_state() for changing the power state to D0 explicitly. In this case the memory pointed by 'pm_save' will never be freed. In a malicious sequence the state changing to D3hot followed by VFIO_DEVICE_RESET/VFIO_DEVICE_PCI_HOT_RESET can be run in a loop and it can cause an OOM situation.  This patch frees the earlier allocated memory first before overwriting 'pm_save' to prevent the mentioned memory leak.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2023-47641,aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Affected versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability regarding the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a persistent protocol if both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE) header values are present it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation. A possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked we can pass a chunked123 as TE the frontend entity will ignore this header and will parse Content-Length. The impact of this vulnerability is that it is possible to bypass any proxy rule poisoning sockets to other users like passing Authentication Headers also if it is present an Open Redirect an attacker could combine it to redirect random users to another website and log the request. This vulnerability has been addressed in release 3.8.0 of aiohttp. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,3.4,CWE-444

CVE-2022-25277,Drupal core sanitizes filenames with dangerous extensions upon upload (reference: SA-CORE-2020-012) and strips leading and trailing dots from filenames to prevent uploading server configuration files (reference: SA-CORE-2019-010). However the protections for these two vulnerabilities previously did not work correctly together. As a result if the site were configured to allow the upload of files with an htaccess extension these files' filenames would not be properly sanitized. This could allow bypassing the protections provided by Drupal core's default .htaccess files and possible remote code execution on Apache web servers. This issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires a field administrator to explicitly configure a file field to allow htaccess as an extension (a restricted permission) or a contributed module or custom code that overrides allowed file uploads.,7.2,CWE-434

CVE-2024-45818,The hypervisor contains code to accelerate VGA memory accesses for HVM guests when the (virtual) VGA is in standard mode.  Locking involved there has an unusual discipline leaving a lock acquired past the return from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a problem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses both of which touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't relevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access the lock that is already being held would be attempted to be re-acquired resulting in a deadlock.  This deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced but was analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light of the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking discipline work.  In staging this logic has all been removed because it was discovered to be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore we are fixing the locking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note that even with the feature disabled the lock would still be acquired for any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.,6.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-52519,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Disable and reenable ACPI GPE bit  The EHL (Elkhart Lake) based platforms provide a OOB (Out of band) service which allows to wakup device when the system is in S5 (Soft-Off state). This OOB service can be enabled/disabled from BIOS settings. When enabled the ISH device gets PME wake capability. To enable PME wakeup driver also needs to enable ACPI GPE bit.  On resume BIOS will clear the wakeup bit. So driver need to re-enable it in resume function to keep the next wakeup capability.
