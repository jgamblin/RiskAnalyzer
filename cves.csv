CVE-2023-30548,gatsby-plugin-sharp is a plugin for the gatsby framework which exposes functions built on the Sharp image processing library. The gatsby-plugin-sharp plugin prior to versions 5.8.1 and 4.25.1 contains a path traversal vulnerability exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`). It should be noted that by default gatsby develop is only accessible via the localhost 127.0.0.1 and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as --host 0.0.0.0 -H 0.0.0.0 or the GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0 environment variable. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability will have read access to all files within the scope of the server process. A patch has been introduced in gatsby-plugin-sharp@5.8.1 and gatsby-plugin-sharp@4.25.1 which mitigates the issue by ensuring that included paths remain within the project directory. As stated above by default gatsby develop is only exposed to the localhost 127.0.0.1. For those using the develop server in the default configuration no risk is posed. If other ranges are required preventing the develop server from being exposed to untrusted interfaces or IP address ranges would mitigate the risk from this vulnerability. Users are non the less encouraged to upgrade to a safe version.,4.3,CWE-22

CVE-2022-29246,Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host device and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack. Prior to version 6.1.11 he USBX DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function does not assure that a buffer overflow will not occur during handling of the DFU UPLOAD command. When an attacker issues the `UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD` control transfer request with `wLenght` larger than the buffer size (`UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH` 256 bytes) depending on the actual implementation of `dfu -> ux_slave_class_dfu_read` a buffer overflow may occur. In example `ux_slave_class_dfu_read` may read 4096 bytes (or more up to 65k) to a 256 byte buffer ultimately resulting in an overflow. Furthermore in case an attacker has some control over the read flash memory this may result in execution of arbitrary code and platform compromise. A fix for this issue has been included in USBX release 6.1.11. As a workaround align request and buffer size to assure that buffer boundaries are respected.,9.8,CWE-120

A `ProtoNode` may be modified in such a way as to cause various encode errors which will trigger a panic on common method calls that don't allow for error returns. A `ProtoNode` should only be able to encode to valid DAG-PB attempting to encode invalid DAG-PB forms will result in an error from the codec. Manipulation of an existing (newly created or decoded) `ProtoNode` using the modifier methods did not account for certain states that would place the `ProtoNode` into an unencodeable form. Due to conformance with the [`github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block) and [`github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node) interfaces certain methods which internally require a re-encode if state has changed will panic due to the inability to return an error. This issue has been addressed across a number of pull requests. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.8.1 for a complete set of fixes. Users unable to upgrade may attempt to mitigate this issue by sanitising inputs when allowing user-input to set a new `CidBuilder` on a `ProtoNode` and by sanitising `Tsize` (`Link#Size`) values such that they are a reasonable byte-size for sub-DAGs where derived from user-input. ,7.5,CWE-755
