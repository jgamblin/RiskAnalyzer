CVE-2023-21707,Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,8.8,CWE-502
CVE-2025-52883,Meshtastic-Android is an Android application for the mesh radio software Meshtastic. Prior to version 2.5.21 an attacker is able to send an unencrypted direct message to a victim impersonating any other node of the mesh. This message will be displayed in the same chat that the victim normally communicates with the other node and it will appear as using PKC while it is not. This means that the victim will be provided with a false sense of security due to the green padlock displayed when using PKC and they'll read the attacker's message as legitimate. Version 2.5.21 contains a patch for the issue. It is suggested to implement a stricter control on whether a message has been received using PKC or using the shared Meshtastic channel key. Moreover instead of showing no green padlock icon in the chat with no PKC consider using an explicit indicator like for example the yellow half-open padlock displayed when in HAM mode. This remediation however applies to the client applications rather than the Meshtastic firmware.,5.3,CWE-1287

CVE-2022-31083,Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2 the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter.

CVE-2024-53844,E.D.D.I (Enhanced Dialog Driven Interface) is a middleware to connect and manage LLM API bots. A path traversal vulnerability exists in the backup export functionality of EDDI as implemented in `RestExportService.java`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `botFilename` parameter in requests. The application fails to sanitize user input enabling malicious inputs such as `..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` to access arbitrary files. However the **severity of this vulnerability is significantly limited** because EDDI typically runs within a **Docker container** which provides additional layers of isolation and restricted permissions. As a result while this vulnerability exposes files within the container it does not inherently threaten the underlying host system or other containers. A patch is required to sanitize and validate the botFilename input parameter. Users should ensure they are using version 5.4 which contains this patdch. For temporary mitigation access to the vulnerable endpoint should be restricted through firewall rules or authentication mechanisms.,6.3,CWE-22

CVE-2025-29770,vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. The outlines library is one of the backends used by vLLM to support structured output (a.k.a. guided decoding). Outlines provides an optional cache for its compiled grammars on the local filesystem. This cache has been on by default in vLLM. Outlines is also available by default through the OpenAI compatible API server. The affected code in vLLM is vllm/model_executor/guided_decoding/outlines_logits_processors.py which unconditionally uses the cache from outlines. A malicious user can send a stream of very short decoding requests with unique schemas resulting in an addition to the cache for each request. This can result in a Denial of Service if the filesystem runs out of space. Note that even if vLLM was configured to use a different backend by default it is still possible to choose outlines on a per-request basis using the guided_decoding_backend key of the extra_body field of the request.

CVE-2025-0684,A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup from a reiserfs filesystem grub's reiserfs fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size however it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the grub_reiserfs_read_symlink() will call grub_reiserfs_read_real() with a overflown length parameter leading to a heap based out-of-bounds write during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and can result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.,6.4,CWE-787

CVE-2023-50386,Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2 from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.  In the affected versions Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API. When backing up Solr Collections these configSet files would be saved to disk when using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups). If the backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its ClassPath/ClassLoaders then the jar and class files would be available to use with any ConfigSet trusted or untrusted.  When Solr is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled) as is strongly suggested this vulnerability is limited to extending the Backup permissions with the ability to add libraries. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1 which fix the issue. In these versions the following protections have been added:    *  Users are no longer able to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via a Java ClassLoader.   *  The Backup API restricts saving backups to directories that are used in the ClassLoader.,8.8,CWE-434

CVE-2024-50273,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list  At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF we delete the ref from its ref head's ref_add_list using list_del() which leaves the ref's add_list member not reinitialized as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2 respectively.  If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref which can happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction abort we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call list_empty() against the ref's add_list which returns false since the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison pointers resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences otherwise.  So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.,5.5,CWE-908

CVE-2024-2746,Incomplete fix for CVE-2024-1929  The problem with CVE-2024-1929 was that the dnf5 D-Bus daemon accepted arbitrary configuration parameters from unprivileged users which allowed a local root exploit by tricking the daemon into loading a user controlled plugin. All of this happened before Polkit authentication was even started.  The dnf5 library code does not check whether non-root users control the directory in question.   On one hand this poses a Denial-of-Service attack vector by making the daemonoperate on a blocking file (e.g. named FIFO special file) or a very large file that causes an out-of-memory situation (e.g. /dev/zero). On the other hand this can be used to let the daemon process privileged files like /etc/shadow. The file in question is parsed as an INI file. Error diagnostics resulting from parsing privileged files could cause information leaks if these diagnostics are accessible to unprivileged users. In the case of libdnf5 no such user accessible diagnostics should exist though.  Also a local attacker can place a valid repository configuration file in this directory. This configuration file allows to specify a plethora of additional configuration options. This makes various additional code paths in libdnf5 accessible to the attacker.,8.8,CWE-20
