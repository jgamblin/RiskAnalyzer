CVE-2023-32677,Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with unique topic-based threading. Zulip administrators can configure Zulip to limit who can add users to streams and separately to limit who can invite users to the organization. In Zulip Server 6.1 and below the UI which allows a user to invite a new user also allows them to set the streams that the new user is invited to -- even if the inviting user would not have permissions to add an existing user to streams.

CVE-2023-0286,There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.  When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag) this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point which is uncommon. As such this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.,7.4,CWE-843

CVE-2025-52951,A Protection Mechanism Failure vulnerability in kernel filter processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker sending IPv6 traffic destined to the device to effectively bypass any firewall filtering configured on the interface.  Due to an issue with Junos OS kernel filter processing the 'payload-protocol' match is not being supported causing any term containing it to accept all packets without taking any other action.

CVE-2024-46842,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info  The MBX_TIMEOUT return code is not handled in lpfc_get_sfp_info and the routine unconditionally frees submitted mailbox commands regardless of return status.  The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases when firmware returns SFP information at a later time that same mailbox memory region references previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.  Fix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox resource cleanup check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not timeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set then do not free the resources because it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later time in its cmpl routine.  Also increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot scripts requiring longer timeouts.,5.5,CWE-416

CVE-2022-29238,Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. Prior to version 6.4.12 authenticated requests to the notebook server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing the contents of hidden directories not accessing individual hidden files or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to be disallowed. Because fully authenticated requests are required this is of relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitive files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh` while serving $HOME) then any authenticated requests could access files if their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access to the server and therefore execution permissions which also generally grants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result in any privilege escalation or increase in information access only an additional unintended means by which the files could be accessed. Version 6.4.12 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.,4.3,CWE-425

CVE-2024-27919,Envoy is a cloud-native open-source edge and service proxy. In versions 1.29.0 and 1.29.1 theEnvoy HTTP/2 protocol stack is vulnerable to the flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec does not reset a request when header map limits have been exceeded. This allows an attacker to send an sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing unlimited memory consumption. This can lead to denial of service through memory exhaustion. Users should upgrade to versions 1.29.2 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood. Note that this vulnerability is a regression in Envoy version 1.29.0 and 1.29.1 only.

CVE-2021-47227,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/fpu: Prevent state corruption in __fpu__restore_sig()  The non-compacted slowpath uses __copy_from_user() and copies the entire user buffer into the kernel buffer verbatim.  This means that the kernel buffer may now contain entirely invalid state on which XRSTOR will #GP. validate_user_xstate_header() can detect some of that corruption but that leaves the onus on callers to clear the buffer.  Prior to XSAVES support it was possible just to reinitialize the buffer completely but with supervisor states that is not longer possible as the buffer clearing code split got it backwards. Fixing that is possible but not corrupting the state in the first place is more robust.  Avoid corruption of the kernel XSAVE buffer by using copy_user_to_xstate() which validates the XSAVE header contents before copying the actual states to the kernel. copy_user_to_xstate() was previously only called for compacted-format kernel buffers but it works for both compacted and non-compacted forms.  Using it for the non-compacted form is slower because of multiple __copy_from_user() operations but that cost is less important than robust code in an already slow path.

CVE-2025-64484,OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions prior to 7.13.0 all deployments of OAuth2 Proxy in front of applications that normalize underscores to dashes in HTTP headers (e.g. WSGI-based frameworks such as Django Flask FastAPI and PHP applications). Authenticated users can inject underscore variants of X-Forwarded-* headers that bypass the proxy’s filtering logic potentially escalating privileges in the upstream app. OAuth2 Proxy authentication/authorization itself is not compromised. The problem has been patched with v7.13.0. By default all specified headers will now be normalized meaning that both capitalization and the use of underscores (_) versus dashes (-) will be ignored when matching headers to be stripped. For example both `X-Forwarded-For` and `X_Forwarded-for` will now be treated as equivalent and stripped away. For those who have a rational that requires keeping a similar looking header and not stripping it the maintainers introduced a new configuration field for Headers managed through the AlphaConfig called `InsecureSkipHeaderNormalization`. As a workaround ensure filtering and processing logic in upstream services don't treat underscores and hyphens in Headers the same way.,8.5,CWE-644
