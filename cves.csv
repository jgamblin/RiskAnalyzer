CVE-2024-36114,Aircompressor is a library with ports of the Snappy LZO LZ4 and Zstandard compression algorithms to Java. All decompressor implementations of Aircompressor (LZ4 LZO Snappy Zstandard) can crash the JVM for certain input and in some cases also leak the content of other memory of the Java process (which could contain sensitive information). When decompressing certain data the decompressors try to access memory outside the bounds of the given byte arrays or byte buffers. Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++ namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed. When decompressing data from untrusted users this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM or to leak other sensitive information from the Java process. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,8.6,CWE-125

CVE-2024-54150,cjwt is a C JSON Web Token (JWT) Implementation. Algorithm confusion occurs when a system improperly verifies the type of signature used allowing attackers to exploit the lack of distinction between signing methods.  If the system doesn't differentiate between an HMAC signed token and an RS/EC/PS signed token during verification it becomes vulnerable to this kind of attack. For instance an attacker could craft a token with the alg field set to HS256 while the server expects an asymmetric algorithm like RS256. The server might mistakenly use the wrong verification method such as using a public key as the HMAC secret leading to unauthorised access. For RSA the key can be computed from a few signatures. For Elliptic Curve (EC) two potential keys can be recovered from one signature. This can be used to bypass the signature mechanism if an application relies on asymmetrically signed tokens. This issue has been addressed in version 2.3.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,9.1,CWE-347

CVE-2022-31006,indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy and are not related to a particular release.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2024-49856,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/sgx: Fix deadlock in SGX NUMA node search  When the current node doesn't have an EPC section configured by firmware and all other EPC sections are used up CPU can get stuck inside the while loop that looks for an available EPC page from remote nodes indefinitely leading to a soft lockup. Note how nid_of_current will never be equal to nid in that while loop because nid_of_current is not set in sgx_numa_mask.  Also worth mentioning is that it's perfectly fine for the firmware not to setup an EPC section on a node. While setting up an EPC section on each node can enhance performance it is not a requirement for functionality.  Rework the loop to start and end on *a* node that has SGX memory. This avoids the deadlock looking for the current SGX-lacking node to show up in the loop when it never will.,5.5,CWE-835

CVE-2022-23538,github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client is the Go client for the Singularity Container Services (SCS) Container Library Service. When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image with authentication the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow with redirect to S3 is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io) does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation using a 3rd party S3 storage service are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.,5.2,CWE-522

CVE-2024-53848,check-jsonschema is a CLI and set of pre-commit hooks for jsonschema validation. The default cache strategy uses the basename of a remote schema as the name of the file in the cache e.g. `https://example.org/schema.json` will be stored as `schema.json`. This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL e.g. `https://example.evil.org/schema.json` they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used instead of the appropriate schema. Such a cache confusion attack could be used to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected. This issue has been patched in version 0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. A few workarounds exist: 1. Users can use `--no-cache` to disable caching. 2. Users can use `--cache-filename` to select filenames for use in the cache or to ensure that other usages do not overwrite the cached schema. (Note: this flag is being deprecated as part of the remediation effort.) 3. Users can explicitly download the schema before use as a local file as in `curl -LOs https://example.org/schema.json; check-jsonschema --schemafile ./schema.json`,7.1,CWE-349

CVE-2022-39229,Grafana is an open source data visualization platform for metrics logs and traces. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to block another user's login attempt by registering someone else'e email address as a username. A Grafana user’s username and email address are unique fields that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user. A user can have an email address as a username. However the login system allows users to log in with either username or email address. Since Grafana allows a user to log in with either their username or email address this creates an usual behavior where `user_1` can register with one email address and `user_2` can register their username as `user_1`’s email address. This prevents `user_1` logging into the application since `user_1`'s password won’t match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.,4.3,CWE-287
CVE-2024-23648,Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for Pimcore.

This token is highly sensitive ; as an attacker able to retrieve it would be able to resets the user's password. Prior to version 1.2.3 the reset-password URL is crafted using the Host HTTP header of the request sent to request a password reset. This way an external attacker could send password requests for users but specify a Host header of a website that they control. If the user receiving the mail clicks on the link the attacker would retrieve the reset token of the victim and perform account takeover. Version 1.2.3 fixes this issue.,8.8,CWE-74
