CVE-2022-48847,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  watch_queue: Fix filter limit check  In watch_queue_set_filter() there are a couple of places where we check that the filter type value does not exceed what the type_filter bitmap can hold.  One place calculates the number of bits by:     if (tf[i].type >= sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * 8)  which is fine but the second does:     if (tf[i].type >= sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * BITS_PER_LONG)  which is not.  This can lead to a couple of out-of-bounds writes due to a too-large type:   (1) __set_bit() on wfilter->type_filter  (2) Writing more elements in wfilter->filters[] than we allocated.  Fix this by just using the proper WATCH_TYPE__NR instead which is the number of types we actually know about.  The bug may cause an oops looking something like:    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in watch_queue_set_filter+0x659/0x740   Write of size 4 at addr ffff88800d2c66bc by task watch_queue_oob/611   ...

CVE-2025-21640,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: sysctl: cookie_hmac_alg: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only   from the opener's netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases resulting in an 'Oops'   (null-ptr-deref) e.g. when the current task is exiting as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using container_of().

CVE-2024-29737,In streampark the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally only users of that system have the authorization to log in and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.  Mitigation:  all users should upgrade to 2.1.4  Background info:  Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1 test2 test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the Build Argument. Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character `. As a result you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.  In the latest version the special symbol ` is intercepted.,4.7,CWE-77

CVE-2022-31091,Guzzle an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. In affected versions on making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different port if we choose to follow it we should remove the `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers from the request before containing. Previously we would only consider a change in host or scheme. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2 where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. An alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware rather than ours if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed one should simply disable redirects all together.,7.7,CWE-200

CVE-2024-51504,When using IPAuthenticationProvider in ZooKeeper Admin Server there is a possibility of Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -- this only impacts IP based authentication implemented in ZooKeeper Admin Server. Default configuration of client's IP address detection in IPAuthenticationProvider which uses HTTP request headers is weak and allows an attacker to bypass authentication via spoofing client's IP address in request headers.
