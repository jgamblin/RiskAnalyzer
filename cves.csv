CVE-2022-50411,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPICA: Fix error code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()  A use-after-free in acpi_ps_parse_aml() after a failing invocaion of acpi_ds_call_control_method() is reported by KASAN [1] and code inspection reveals that next_walk_state pushed to the thread by acpi_ds_create_walk_state() is freed on errors but it is not popped from the thread beforehand.  Thus acpi_ds_get_current_walk_state() called by acpi_ps_parse_aml() subsequently returns it as the new walk state which is incorrect.  To address this make acpi_ds_call_control_method() call acpi_ds_pop_walk_state() to pop next_walk_state from the thread before returning an error.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2025-38538,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: nbpfaxi: Fix memory corruption in probe()  The nbpf->chan[] array is allocated earlier in the nbpf_probe() function and it has num_channels elements.  These three loops iterate one element farther than they should and corrupt memory.  The changes to the second loop are more involved.  In this case we're copying data from the irqbuf[] array into the nbpf->chan[] array.  If the data in irqbuf[i] is the error IRQ then we skip it so the iterators are not in sync.  I added a check to ensure that we don't go beyond the end of the irqbuf[] array.  I'm pretty sure this can't happen but it seemed harmless to add a check.  On the other hand after the loop has ended there is a check to ensure that the chan iterator is where we expect it to be.  In the original code we went one element beyond the end of the array so the iterator wasn't in the correct place and it would always return -EINVAL.  However now it will always be in the correct place.  I deleted the check since we know the result.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2025-39713,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: rainshadow-cec: fix TOCTOU race condition in rain_interrupt()  In the interrupt handler rain_interrupt() the buffer full check on rain->buf_len is performed before acquiring rain->buf_lock. This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition as rain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work handler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.  Multiple interrupt invocations can race with each reading buf_len before it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both interrupts attempting to write to the buffer incrementing buf_len beyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.  Fix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full check. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification are performed atomically preventing the race condition. An corresponding spin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the lock.  This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool developed by our team.,4.7,CWE-367

CVE-2023-26487,Vega is a visualization grammar a declarative format for creating saving and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend' function accepts 3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on the 1st argument specifying array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments as `push` call argument. The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature but some can e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments.

CVE-2022-31166,XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform a generic wiki platform. Starting in versions 11.3.7 11.0.3 and 12.0RC1 it is possible to exploit a bug in XWikiRights resolution of groups to obtain privilege escalation. More specifically editing a right with the object editor leads to adding a supplementary empty value to groups which is then resolved as a reference to XWiki.WebHome page. Adding an XWikiGroup xobject to that page then transforms it to a group any user put in that group would then obtain the privileges related to the edited right. Note that this security issue is normally mitigated by the fact that XWiki.WebHome (and XWiki space in general) should be protected by default for edit rights. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.4 and 14.2RC1 to not consider anymore empty values in XWikiRights. It's possible to work around the problem by setting appropriate rights on XWiki.WebHome page to prevent users to edit it.,8.1,CWE-269

CVE-2022-49219,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/pci: fix memory leak during D3hot to D0 transition  If 'vfio_pci_core_device::needs_pm_restore' is set (PCI device does not have No_Soft_Reset bit set in its PMCSR config register) then the current PCI state will be saved locally in 'vfio_pci_core_device::pm_save' during D0->D3hot transition and same will be restored back during D3hot->D0 transition. For saving the PCI state locally pci_store_saved_state() is being used and the pci_load_and_free_saved_state() will free the allocated memory.  But for reset related IOCTLs vfio driver calls PCI reset-related API's which will internally change the PCI power state back to D0. So when the guest resumes then it will get the current state as D0 and it will skip the call to vfio_pci_set_power_state() for changing the power state to D0 explicitly. In this case the memory pointed by 'pm_save' will never be freed. In a malicious sequence the state changing to D3hot followed by VFIO_DEVICE_RESET/VFIO_DEVICE_PCI_HOT_RESET can be run in a loop and it can cause an OOM situation.  This patch frees the earlier allocated memory first before overwriting 'pm_save' to prevent the mentioned memory leak.,5.5,CWE-401

Hail relies on OpenID Connect (OIDC) email addresses from ID tokens to verify the validity of a user's domain but because users have the ability to change their email address they could create accounts and use resources in clusters that they should not have access to. For example a user could create a Microsoft or Google account and then change their email to `test@example.org`. This account can then be used to create a Hail Batch account in Hail Batch clusters whose organization domain is `example.org`. The attacker is not able to access private data or impersonate another user but they would have the ability to run jobs if Hail Batch billing projects are enabled and create Azure Tenants if they have Azure Active Directory Administrator access.,5.3,CWE-289
