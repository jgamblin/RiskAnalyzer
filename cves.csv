CVE-2024-42484,ESP-NOW Component provides a connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol. An Out-of-Bound (OOB) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW group type message because there is no check for the addrs_num field of the group type message. This can result in memory corruption related attacks. Normally there are two fields in the group information that need to be checked i.e. the addrs_num field and the addrs_list fileld. Since we only checked the addrs_list field an attacker can send a group type message with an invalid addrs_num field which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer thus causing a memory corruption issue that goes beyond the payload length.,6.5,CWE-125

CVE-2024-57890,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue  In the expression cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count both variables are u32 values that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer wrapping.  Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also could potentially wrap.  The cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge) multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on 64bit systems.  This patch does two things.  First I've re-arranged the condition in uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable len is on one side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modified all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2022-20650,A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user supplied data that is sent to the NX-API.

CVE-2025-56449,A security vulnerability was identified in Obsidian Scheduler's REST API 5.0.0 thru 6.3.0. If an account is locked out due to not enrolling in MFA (e.g. after the 7-day enforcement window) the REST API still allows the use of Basic Authentication to authenticate and perform administrative actions. In particular the default admin account was found to be locked out via the web interface but still usable through the REST API. This allowed creation of a new privileged user bypassing MFA protections. This undermines the intended security posture of MFA enforcement.,8.2,CWE-290

CVE-2025-38620,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  zloop: fix KASAN use-after-free of tag set  When a zoned loop device or zloop device is removed KASAN enabled kernel reports BUG KASAN use-after-free in blk_mq_free_tag_set(). The BUG happens because zloop_ctl_remove() calls put_disk() which invokes zloop_free_disk(). The zloop_free_disk() frees the memory allocated for the zlo pointer. However after the memory is freed zloop_ctl_remove() calls blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set) which accesses the freed zlo. Hence the KASAN use-after-free.   zloop_ctl_remove()   put_disk(zlo->disk)    put_device()     kobject_put()      ...       zloop_free_disk()         kvfree(zlo)   blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set)  To avoid the BUG move the call to blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set) from zloop_ctl_remove() into zloop_free_disk(). This ensures that the tag_set is freed before the call to kvfree(zlo).,7.8,CWE-416
CVE-2022-31008,RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. In affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used to encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means that in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions: `3.10.2` `3.9.18` `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.,5.5,CWE-330

CVE-2024-34359,llama-cpp-python is the Python bindings for llama.cpp. `llama-cpp-python` depends on class `Llama` in `llama.py` to load `.gguf` llama.cpp or Latency Machine Learning Models. The `__init__` constructor built in the `Llama` takes several parameters to configure the loading and running of the model. Other than `NUMA LoRa settings` `loading tokenizers` and `hardware settings` `__init__` also loads the `chat template` from targeted `.gguf` 's Metadata and furtherly parses it to `llama_chat_format.Jinja2ChatFormatter.to_chat_handler()` to construct the `self.chat_handler` for this model. Nevertheless `Jinja2ChatFormatter` parse the `chat template` within the Metadate with sandbox-less `jinja2.Environment` which is furthermore rendered in `__call__` to construct the `prompt` of interaction. This allows `jinja2` Server Side Template Injection which leads to remote code execution by a carefully constructed payload.,9.6,CWE-76

CVE-2024-53267,sigstore-java is a sigstore java client for interacting with sigstore infrastructure. sigstore-java has insufficient verification for a situation where a validly-signed but mismatched bundle is presented as proof of inclusion into a transparency log. This bug impacts clients using any variation of KeylessVerifier.verify(). The verifier may accept a bundle with an unrelated log entry cryptographically verifying everything but fails to ensure the log entry applies to the artifact in question thereby verifying a bundle without any proof the signing event was logged. This allows the creation of a bundle without fulcio certificate and private key combined with an unrelated but time-correct log entry to fake logging of a signing event. A malicious actor using a compromised identity may want to do this to prevent discovery via rekor's log monitors. The signer's identity will still be available to the verifier. The signature on the bundle must still be on the correct artifact for the verifier to pass. sigstore-gradle-plugin and sigstore-maven-plugin are not affected by this as they only provide signing functionality. This issue has been patched in v1.1.0 release with PR #856. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.5,CWE-347
