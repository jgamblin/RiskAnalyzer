CVE-2021-47227,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/fpu: Prevent state corruption in __fpu__restore_sig()  The non-compacted slowpath uses __copy_from_user() and copies the entire user buffer into the kernel buffer verbatim.  This means that the kernel buffer may now contain entirely invalid state on which XRSTOR will #GP. validate_user_xstate_header() can detect some of that corruption but that leaves the onus on callers to clear the buffer.  Prior to XSAVES support it was possible just to reinitialize the buffer completely but with supervisor states that is not longer possible as the buffer clearing code split got it backwards. Fixing that is possible but not corrupting the state in the first place is more robust.  Avoid corruption of the kernel XSAVE buffer by using copy_user_to_xstate() which validates the XSAVE header contents before copying the actual states to the kernel. copy_user_to_xstate() was previously only called for compacted-format kernel buffers but it works for both compacted and non-compacted forms.  Using it for the non-compacted form is slower because of multiple __copy_from_user() operations but that cost is less important than robust code in an already slow path.

CVE-2023-22474,Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js.

CVE-2024-3110,A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application affecting versions up to and including the latest before 1.0.0. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied URLs before embedding them into the application UI as external links with custom icons. Specifically the application does not prevent the inclusion of 'javascript:' protocol payloads in URLs which can be exploited by a user with manager role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's session. This flaw can be leveraged to steal the admin's authorization token by crafting malicious URLs that when clicked by the admin send the token to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use this token to perform unauthorized actions escalate privileges to admin or directly take over the admin account. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious link is opened in a new tab using either the CTRL + left mouse button click or the mouse scroll wheel click or in some non-updated versions of modern browsers by directly clicking on the link.,8.7,CWE-79

CVE-2023-46232,era-compiler-vyper is the EraVM Vyper compiler for zkSync Era a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum. Prior to era-compiler-vype version 1.3.10 a bug prevented the initialization of the first immutable variable for Vyper contracts meeting certain criteria. The problem arises when there is a String or Array with more 256-bit words allocated than initialized. It results in the second word’s index unset that is effectively set to 0 so the first immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the ImmutableSimulator. Version 1.3.10 fixes this issue by setting all indexes in advance. The problem will go away but it will get more expensive if the user allocates a lot of uninitialized space e.g. `String[4096]`. Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way of working around the issue. ,5.3,CWE-471

This means that if an application assigns a view's `tagName` to user-supplied data a specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (XSS). This vulnerability only affects applications that assign or bind user-provided content to `tagName`.,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2024-57953,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: tps6594: Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems  The problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset()  	tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;  The tmp variable is an s64 but offset is a long in the (-277774)-277774 range.  On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to approximately two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large (32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million.  When you start multiplying by a hundred million it doesn't take long to overflow the two billion mark.  Probably the safest way to fix this is to change the type of TICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because it's such a large number.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2025-29911,CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted AOS frame with an insufficient length. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` specifically during the processing of the Frame Error Control Field (FECF). The affected code attempts to read from the `p_ingest` buffer at indices `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 2` and `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 1` without verifying if `len_ingest` is sufficiently large. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when `len_ingest` is smaller than `max_frame_size`. As of time of publication no known patched versions exist.,9.8,CWE-122

CVE-2024-52303,aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11 a memory leak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.,7.5,CWE-772
