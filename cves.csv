CVE-2023-44392,Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65 Garden has a dependency on the cryo library which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap` which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.,8.2,CWE-94

CVE-2024-28186,FreeScout is an open source help desk and shared inbox built with PHP.  A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the application to users of the application. This issue arises from the application storing complete stack traces of exceptions in its database. The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to users via the `/conversation/ajax-html/send_log?folder_id=&thread_id={id}` endpoint. The stack trace reveals value of parameters including the username and password passed to the `Swift_Transport_Esmtp_Auth_LoginAuthenticator->authenticate()` function. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to SMTP server credentials. With this sensitive information in hand the attacker can potentially send unauthorized emails from the compromised SMTP server posing a severe threat to the confidentiality and integrity of email communications. This could lead to targeted attacks on both the application users and the organization itself compromising the security of email exchange servers. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.124.

CVE-2025-30216,CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`). When processing the Secondary Header Length of a TM protocol packet if the Secondary Header Length exceeds the packet's total length a heap overflow is triggered during the memcpy operation that copies packet data into the dynamically allocated buffer `p_new_dec_frame`. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent heap memory potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability.

CVE-2024-53088,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state  Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN filters by setting mac and port VLAN.  1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan(). 2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac(). 3. Subsequently i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters() which         refers to the already freed filter memory causing corruption.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn multiple VFs. 2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change         MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host. 3. Observe errors in dmesg: Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX 	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX.  Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.  The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.

CVE-2022-39248,matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow for example to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.,8.6,CWE-287
