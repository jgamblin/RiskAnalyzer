CVE-2024-25617,Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP HTTPS FTP and more. Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP header parsing. This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or reply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default. In Squid version 6.5 and later the default setting of these parameters is safe. Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator is setting these parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this time prevent these settings from being changed to unsafe values. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.5. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as SQUID-2024:2,5.3,CWE-182

CVE-2025-38000,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sch_hfsc: Fix qlen accounting bug when using peek in hfsc_enqueue()  When enqueuing the first packet to an HFSC class hfsc_enqueue() calls the child qdisc's peek() operation before incrementing sch->q.qlen and sch->qstats.backlog. If the child qdisc uses qdisc_peek_dequeued() this may trigger an immediate dequeue and potential packet drop. In such cases qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is called but the HFSC qdisc's qlen and backlog have not yet been updated leading to inconsistent queue accounting. This can leave an empty HFSC class in the active list causing further consequences like use-after-free.  This patch fixes the bug by moving the increment of sch->q.qlen and sch->qstats.backlog before the call to the child qdisc's peek() operation. This ensures that queue length and backlog are always accurate when packet drops or dequeues are triggered during the peek.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-48229,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds write exists in the driver for IEEE 802.15.4 radios on nRF platforms in the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem is triggered when parsing radio frames in the `read_frame` function in the `arch/cpu/nrf/net/nrf-ieee-driver-arch.c` module. More specifically the `read_frame` function performs an incomplete validation of the payload length of the packet which is a value that can be set by an external party that sends radio packets to a Contiki-NG system. Although the value is validated to be in the range of the MTU length it is not validated to fit into the given buffer into which the packet will be copied. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to update their develop branch or to update to a subsequent release when available. Users unable to upgrade should consider manually applying the changes in PR #2741.,7.0,CWE-787

CVE-2024-53259,quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO the kernel would then return a message too large error on sendmsg i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC) the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially this can be done after completion of the handshake thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.,6.5,CWE-345

CVE-2025-67499,The CNI portmap plugin allows containers to emulate opening a host port forwarding that traffic to the container. Versions 1.6.0 through 1.8.0  inadvertently forward all traffic with the same destination port as the host port when the portmap plugin is configured with the nftables backend thus ignoring the destination IP.

CVE-2024-42145,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  IB/core: Implement a limit on UMAD receive List  The existing behavior of ib_umad which maintains received MAD packets in an unbounded list poses a risk of uncontrolled growth. As user-space applications extract packets from this list the rate of extraction may not match the rate of incoming packets leading to potential list overflow.  To address this we introduce a limit to the size of the list. After considering typical scenarios such as OpenSM processing which can handle approximately 100k packets per second and the 1-second retry timeout for most packets we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets received beyond this limit are dropped assuming they are likely timed out by the time they are handled by user-space.  Notably packets queued on the receive list due to reasons like timed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full.,5.5,CWE-770

CVE-2025-64186,Evervault is a payment security solution. A vulnerability was identified in the `evervault-go` SDK’s attestation verification logic in versions of `evervault-go` prior to 1.3.2 that may allow incomplete documents to pass validation. This may cause the client to trust an enclave operator that does not meet expected integrity guarantees. The exploitability of this issue is limited in Evervault-hosted environments as an attacker would require the pre-requisite ability to serve requests from specific evervault domain names following from our ACME challenge based TLS certificate acquisition pipeline. The vulnerability primarily affects applications which only check PCR8. Though the efficacy is also reduced for applications that check all PCR values the impact is largely remediated by checking PCR 0 1 and 2. The identified issue has been addressed in version 1.3.2 by validating attestation documents before storing in the cache and replacing the naive equality checks with a new SatisfiedBy check. Those who useevervault-go to attest Enclaves that are hosted outside of Evervault environments and cannot upgrade have two possible workarounds available. Modify the application logic to fail verification if PCR8 is not explicitly present and non-empty and/or add custom pre-validation to reject documents that omit any required PCRs.,8.7,CWE-347

CVE-2024-28193,your_spotify is an open source self hosted Spotify tracking dashboard. YourSpotify version <1.8.0 allows users to create a public token in the settings which can be used to provide guest-level access to the information of that specific user in YourSpotify. The /me API endpoint discloses Spotify API access and refresh tokens to guest users. Attackers with access to a public token for guest access to YourSpotify can therefore obtain access to Spotify API tokens of YourSpotify users. As a consequence attackers may extract profile information information about listening habits playlists and other information from the corresponding Spotify profile. In addition the attacker can pause and resume playback in the Spotify app at will. This issue has been resolved in version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,6.5,CWE-200

CVE-2023-50926,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read can be caused by an incoming DIO message when using the RPL-Lite implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system. More specifically the prefix information of the DIO message contains a field that specifies the length of an IPv6 address prefix. The value of this field is not validated which means that an attacker can set a value that is longer than the maximum prefix length. Subsequently a memcmp function call that compares different prefixes can be called with a length argument that surpasses the boundary of the array allocated for the prefix causing an out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in the next release. Users are advised to update as soon as they are able to or to manually apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2721.,7.5,CWE-125
