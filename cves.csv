CVE-2023-45287,Before Go 1.20 the RSA based TLS key exchanges used the math/big library which is not constant time. RSA blinding was applied to prevent timing attacks but analysis shows this may not have been fully effective. In particular it appears as if the removal of PKCS#1 padding may leak timing information which in turn could be used to recover session key bits. In Go 1.20 the crypto/tls library switched to a fully constant time RSA implementation which we do not believe exhibits any timing side channels.,7.5,CWE-203

CVE-2024-42018,An issue was discovered in Atos Eviden SMC xScale before 1.6.6. During initialization of nodes some configuration parameters are retrieved from management nodes. These parameters embed credentials whose integrity and confidentiality may be important to the security of the HPC configuration. Because these parameters are needed for initialization there is no available mechanism to ensure access control on the management node and a mitigation measure is normally put in place to prevent access to unprivileged users. It was discovered that this mitigation measure does not survive a reboot of diskful nodes. (Diskless nodes are not at risk.)

CVE-2022-24817,Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0 helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0 and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-tenancy deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions. Workarounds include disabling functionality via Validating Admission webhooks by restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig` field in Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the controller’s pod to limit what binaries can be executed. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.23.0 and helm-controller v0.19.0 both included in flux2 v0.29.0,9.9,CWE-94

CVE-2024-44951,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: sc16is7xx: fix TX fifo corruption  Sometimes when a packet is received on channel A at almost the same time as a packet is about to be transmitted on channel B we observe with a logic analyzer that the received packet on channel A is transmitted on channel B. In other words the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted with data from channel A.  The problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (serial: sc16is7xx: change EFR lock to operate on each channels) which changed the EFR locking to operate on each channel instead of chip-wise.  This commit has introduced a regression because the EFR lock is used not only to protect the EFR registers access but also in a very obscure and undocumented way to protect access to the data buffer which is shared by the Tx and Rx handlers but also by each channel of the IC.  Fix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in sc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.  Secondly replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for each channel.,7.8,CWE-667
CVE-2024-23937,This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Silicon Labs Gecko OS.

CVE-2024-43863,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling  Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove the fence from the pending list and thus doesn't require a lock to fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.  vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all fences and update their status to do that it holds a lock to prevent the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending fences for which it holds a lock.  dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll calls the wait which signals the fences which are being destroyed. The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it was called.  Old bug but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling interfaces. Fix those in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2022-24827,Elide is a Java library that lets you stand up a GraphQL/JSON-API web service with minimal effort. When leveraging the following together: Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic Queries Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter) and a parameterized column of type TEXT. There is the potential for a hacker to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server side authorization filters through SQL injection. A recent patch to Elide 6.1.2 allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT columns. This character can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and allow the attacker to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters. A fix is provided in Elide 6.1.4. The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted). Workarounds include leveraging a different type of parameterized column (TIME MONEY etc) or not leveraging parameterized columns.,8.1,CWE-89

CVE-2024-25619,Mastodon is a free open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. When an OAuth Application is destroyed the streaming server wasn't being informed that the Access Tokens had also been destroyed this could have posed security risks to users by allowing an application to continue listening to streaming after the application had been destroyed. Essentially this comes down to the fact that when Doorkeeper sets up the relationship between Applications and Access Tokens it uses a `dependent: delete_all` configuration which means the `after_commit` callback setup on `AccessTokenExtension` didn't actually fire since `delete_all` doesn't trigger ActiveRecord callbacks. To mitigate we need to add a `before_destroy` callback to `ApplicationExtension` which announces to streaming that all the Application's Access Tokens are being killed. Impact should be negligible given the affected application had to be owned by the user. None the less this issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6 4.1.14 4.0.14 and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability.,3.1,CWE-613

CVE-2022-26477,The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable which if tampered with may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix we added an upper bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We classify it as a low-priority but useful improvement. SystemDS is a distributed system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in many code paths (e.g. on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence files) the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints. In this particular case though the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number of columns which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in a consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly improved with almost zero overhead. These code changes are available in versions higher than 2.2.1.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2024-56326,Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5 An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.,7.8,CWE-693
