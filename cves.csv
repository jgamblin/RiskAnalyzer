CVE-2024-10978,Incorrect privilege assignment in PostgreSQL allows a less-privileged application user to view or change different rows from those intended.  An attack requires the application to use SET ROLE SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION or an equivalent feature.

The attacker does not control which incorrect user ID applies.  Query text from less-privileged sources is not a concern here because SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION are not sandboxes for unvetted queries.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1 16.5 15.9 14.14 13.17 and 12.21 are affected.,4.2,CWE-266

CVE-2023-53020,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  l2tp: close all race conditions in l2tp_tunnel_register()  The code in l2tp_tunnel_register() is racy in several ways:  1. It modifies the tunnel socket _after_ publishing it.  2. It calls setup_udp_tunnel_sock() on an existing socket without    locking.  3. It changes sock lock class on fly which triggers many syzbot    reports.  This patch amends all of them by moving socket initialization code before publishing and under sock lock. As suggested by Jakub the l2tp lockdep class is not necessary as we can just switch to bh_lock_sock_nested().,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2024-35177,Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention detection and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises virtualized containerized and cloud-based environments. The wazuh-agent for Windows is vulnerable to a Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability due to improper ACL of the non-default installation directory. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by placing one of the many DLL that are loaded and not present on the system in the installation folder of the agent OR by replacing the service executable binary itself with a malicious one. The root cause is an improper ACL applied on the installation folder when a non-default installation path is specified (e.g: C:\wazuh). Many DLLs are loaded from the installation folder and by creating a malicious DLLs that exports the functions of a legit one (and that is not found on the system where the agent is installed such as rsync.dll) it is possible to escalate privileges from a low-privileged user and obtain code execution under the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.8,CWE-284

CVE-2023-39348,Spinnaker is an open source multi-cloud continuous delivery platform. Log output when updating GitHub status is improperly set to FULL always.

CVE-2023-52137,The [`tj-actions/verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) action allows for command injection in changed filenames allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and potentially leak secrets. The [`verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) workflow returns the list of files changed within a workflow execution. This could potentially allow filenames that contain special characters such as `;` which can be used by an attacker to take over the [GitHub Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) if the output value is used in a raw fashion (thus being directly replaced before execution) inside a `run` block. By running custom commands an attacker may be able to steal secrets such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` if triggered on other events than `pull_request`.  This has been patched in versions [17](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17) and [17.0.0](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17.0.0) by enabling `safe_output` by default and returning filename paths escaping special characters for bash environments.,7.7,CWE-20

Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch for the issue.

CVE-2024-42240,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation  When BHI mitigation is enabled if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set then entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the clear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler (exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the entry_SYSENTER_compat() function.  To address this issue entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY after making sure the TF flag is cleared.  The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:    $ cat sysenter_step.c   int main()   { asm(pushf; pop %ax; bts $8%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter); }    $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c    $ ./sysenter_step   Segmentation fault (core dumped)  The program is expected to crash and the #DB handler will issue a warning.

CVE-2024-47757,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential oob read in nilfs_btree_check_delete()  The function nilfs_btree_check_delete() which checks whether degeneration to direct mapping occurs before deleting a b-tree entry causes memory access outside the block buffer when retrieving the maximum key if the root node has no entries.  This does not usually happen because b-tree mappings with 0 child nodes are never created by mkfs.nilfs2 or nilfs2 itself.  However it can happen if the b-tree root node read from a device is configured that way so fix this potential issue by adding a check for that case.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2024-35225,Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their notebook server and provide authenticated web access to them. Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host` without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>` which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4. As a workaround server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension.,9.6,CWE-79
