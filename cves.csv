CVE-2022-48809,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata  When uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata a new dst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb. This is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specific skb.  The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of 1 which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. When tun_dst_unclone returns the dst+metadata is only referenced from a single place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never drop to 0 (when the skb is consumed) leading to a memory leak.  Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone as the dst+metadata refcount is already 1.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2022-48822,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: f_fs: Fix use-after-free for epfile  Consider a case where ffs_func_eps_disable is called from ffs_func_disable as part of composition switch and at the same time ffs_epfile_release get called from userspace. ffs_epfile_release will free up the read buffer and call ffs_data_closed which in turn destroys ffs->epfiles and mark it as NULL. While this was happening the driver has already initialized the local epfile in ffs_func_eps_disable which is now freed and waiting to acquire the spinlock. Once spinlock is acquired the driver proceeds with the stale value of epfile and tries to free the already freed read buffer causing use-after-free.  Following is the illustration of the race:        CPU1                                  CPU2     ffs_func_eps_disable    epfiles (local copy) 					ffs_epfile_release 					ffs_data_closed 					if (last file closed) 					ffs_data_reset 					ffs_data_clear 					ffs_epfiles_destroy spin_lock dereference epfiles  Fix this races by taking epfiles local copy & assigning it under spinlock and if epfiles(local) is null then update it in ffs->epfiles then finally destroy it. Extending the scope further from the race protecting the ep related structures and concurrent accesses.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-43945,The Linux kernel NFSD implementation prior to versions 5.19.17 and 6.0.2 are vulnerable to buffer overflow. NFSD tracks the number of pages held by each NFSD thread by combining the receive and send buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages. A client can force the send buffer to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage data added at the end of the message. The RPC message with garbage data is still correctly formed according to the specification and is passed forward to handlers. Vulnerable code in NFSD is not expecting the oversized request and writes beyond the allocated buffer space. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,7.5,CWE-131
