CVE-2024-32656,Ant Media Server is live streaming engine software. A local privilege escalation vulnerability in present in versions 2.6.0 through 2.8.2 allows any unprivileged operating system user account to escalate privileges to the root user account on the system. This vulnerability arises from Ant Media Server running with Java Management Extensions (JMX) enabled and authentication disabled on localhost on port 5599/TCP. This vulnerability is nearly identical to the local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-26269 identified in Apache James. Any unprivileged operating system user can connect to the JMX service running on port 5599/TCP on localhost and leverage the MLet Bean within JMX to load a remote MBean from an attacker-controlled server.

CVE-2023-46738,CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A security vulnerability was found in CubeFS HandlerNode in versions prior to 3.3.1 that could allow authenticated users to send maliciously-crafted requests that would crash the ObjectNode and deny other users from using it. The root cause was improper handling of incoming HTTP requests that could allow an attacker to control the ammount of memory that the ObjectNode would allocate. A malicious request could make the ObjectNode allocate more memory that the machine had available and the attacker could exhaust memory by way of a single malicious request. An attacker would need to be authenticated in order to invoke the vulnerable code with their malicious request and have permissions to delete objects. In addition the attacker would need to know the names of existing buckets of the CubeFS deployment - otherwise the request would be rejected before it reached the vulnerable code. As such the most likely attacker is an inside user or an attacker that has breached the account of an existing user in the cluster. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation besides upgrading.,6.5,CWE-770

CVE-2024-53143,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsnotify: Fix ordering of iput() and watched_objects decrement  Ensure the superblock is kept alive until we're done with iput(). Holding a reference to an inode is not allowed unless we ensure the superblock stays alive which fsnotify does by keeping the watched_objects count elevated so iput() must happen before the watched_objects decrement. This can lead to a UAF of something like sb->s_fs_info in tmpfs but the UAF is hard to hit because race orderings that oops are more likely thanks to the CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() block in generic_shutdown_super().  Also ensure that fsnotify_put_sb_watched_objects() doesn't call fsnotify_sb_watched_objects() on a superblock that may have already been freed which would cause a UAF read of sb->s_fsnotify_info.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-22492,ZITADEL is a combination of Auth0 and Keycloak. RefreshTokens is an OAuth 2.0 feature that allows applications to retrieve new access tokens and refresh the user's session without the need for interacting with a UI.

CVE-2024-46676,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: pn533: Add poll mod list filling check  In case of im_protocols value is 1 and tm_protocols value is 0 this combination successfully passes the check 'if (!im_protocols && !tm_protocols)' in the nfc_start_poll(). But then after pn533_poll_create_mod_list() call in pn533_start_poll() poll mod list will remain empty and dev->poll_mod_count will remain 0 which lead to division by zero.  Normally no im protocol has value 1 in the mask so this combination is not expected by driver. But these protocol values actually come from userspace via Netlink interface (NFC_CMD_START_POLL operation). So a broken or malicious program may pass a message containing a bad combination of protocol parameter values so that dev->poll_mod_count is not incremented inside pn533_poll_create_mod_list() thus leading to division by zero. Call trace looks like: nfc_genl_start_poll()   nfc_start_poll()     ->start_poll()     pn533_start_poll()  Add poll mod list filling check.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.,5.5,CWE-369

CVE-2022-33915,Versions of the Amazon AWS Apache Log4j hotpatch package before log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch-1.3.5 are affected by a race condition that could lead to a local privilege escalation. This Hotpatch package is not a replacement for updating to a log4j version that mitigates CVE-2021-44228 or CVE-2021-45046; it provides a temporary mitigation to CVE-2021-44228 by hotpatching the local Java virtual machines. To do so it iterates through all running Java processes performs several checks and executes the Java virtual machine with the same permissions and capabilities as the running process to load the hotpatch. A local user could cause the hotpatch script to execute a binary with elevated privileges by running a custom java process that performs exec() of an SUID binary after the hotpatch has observed the process path and before it has observed its effective user ID.,7.0,CWE-362

CVE-2023-52447,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary  When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab the map may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program. However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map directly through bpf_map_put() if the ref-counter is the last one (which is true for most cases) the inner map will be freed by ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now most .map_free() callbacks don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a RCU grace period so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur use-after-free problem.  Fix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both one RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner map has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is accomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to reduce the size of bpf_map.,6.7,CWE-416

In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization.

CVE-2022-23535,LiteDB is a small fast and lightweight .NET NoSQL embedded database. Versions prior to 5.0.13 are subject to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. LiteDB uses a special field in JSON documents to cast different types from `BsonDocument` to POCO classes. When instances of an object are not the same of class `BsonMapper` use a special field `_type` string info with full class name with assembly to be loaded and fit into your model. If your end-user can send to your app a plain JSON string deserialization can load an unsafe  object to fit into your model. This issue is patched in version 5.0.13 with some basic fixes to avoid this but is not 100% guaranteed when using `Object` type. The next major version will contain an allow-list to select what kind of Assembly can be loaded. Workarounds are detailed in the vendor advisory.,7.3,CWE-502

They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.,7.5,CWE-119
