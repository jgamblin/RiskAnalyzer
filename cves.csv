CVE-2023-25563,GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0 multiple out-of-bounds reads when decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of service. A 32-bit integer overflow condition can lead to incorrect checks of consistency of length of internal buffers. Although most applications will error out before accepting a singe input buffer of 4GB in length this could theoretically happen. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the application allows tokens greater than 4GB in length. This can lead to a large up to 65KB out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-service if it reads from unmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch for the out-of-bounds reads.,5.9,CWE-125

CVE-2024-10976,Incomplete tracking in PostgreSQL of tables with row security allows a reused query to view or change different rows from those intended.  CVE-2023-2455 and CVE-2016-2193 fixed most interaction between row security and user ID changes.  They missed cases where a subquery WITH query security invoker view or SQL-language function references a table with a row-level security policy.  This has the same consequences as the two earlier CVEs.  That is to say it leads to potentially incorrect policies being applied in cases where role-specific policies are used and a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles.  This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs.  Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications.  This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.  An attacker must tailor an attack to a particular application's pattern of query plan reuse user ID changes and role-specific row security policies.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1 16.5 15.9 14.14 13.17 and 12.21 are affected.,4.2,CWE-1250
