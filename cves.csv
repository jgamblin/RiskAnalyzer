CVE-2024-26999,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial/pmac_zilog: Remove flawed mitigation for rx irq flood  The mitigation was intended to stop the irq completely. That may be better than a hard lock-up but it turns out that you get a crash anyway if you're using pmac_zilog as a serial console:  ttyPZ0: pmz: rx irq flood ! BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0 swapper/0  That's because the pr_err() call in pmz_receive_chars() results in pmz_console_write() attempting to lock a spinlock already locked in pmz_interrupt(). With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y this produces a fatal BUG splat. The spinlock in question is the one in struct uart_port.  Even when it's not fatal the serial port rx function ceases to work. Also the iteration limit doesn't play nicely with QEMU as can be seen in the bug report linked below.  A web search for other reports of the error message pmz: rx irq flood didn't produce anything. So I don't think this code is needed any more. Remove it.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-20243,A vulnerability in the RADIUS message processing feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing RADIUS packets.    This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS accounting requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to a network access device (NAD) that uses Cisco ISE for authentication authorization and accounting (AAA). This would eventually result in the NAD sending a RADIUS accounting request packet to Cisco ISE. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RADIUS accounting request packet to Cisco ISE directly if the RADIUS shared secret is known. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the RADIUS process to unexpectedly restart resulting in authentication or authorization timeouts and denying legitimate users access to the network or service. Clients already authenticated to the network would not be affected.    Note: To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) may be required.

CVE-2024-53064,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: fix idpf_vc_core_init error path  In an event where the platform running the device control plane is rebooted reset is detected on the driver. It releases all the resources and waits for the reset to complete. Once the reset is done it tries to build the resources back. At this time if the device control plane is not yet started then the driver timeouts on the virtchnl message and retries to establish the mailbox again.  In the retry flow mailbox is deinitialized but the mailbox workqueue is still alive and polling for the mailbox message. This results in accessing the released control queue leading to null-ptr-deref. Fix it by unrolling the work queue cancellation and mailbox deinitialization in the reverse order which they got initialized.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-49856,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/sgx: Fix deadlock in SGX NUMA node search  When the current node doesn't have an EPC section configured by firmware and all other EPC sections are used up CPU can get stuck inside the while loop that looks for an available EPC page from remote nodes indefinitely leading to a soft lockup. Note how nid_of_current will never be equal to nid in that while loop because nid_of_current is not set in sgx_numa_mask.  Also worth mentioning is that it's perfectly fine for the firmware not to setup an EPC section on a node. While setting up an EPC section on each node can enhance performance it is not a requirement for functionality.  Rework the loop to start and end on *a* node that has SGX memory. This avoids the deadlock looking for the current SGX-lacking node to show up in the loop when it never will.,5.5,CWE-835

CVE-2024-38600,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: Fix deadlocks with kctl removals at disconnection  In snd_card_disconnect() we set card->shutdown flag at the beginning call callbacks and do sync for card->power_ref_sleep waiters at the end.  The callback may delete a kctl element and this can lead to a deadlock when the device was in the suspended state.  Namely:  * A process waits for the power up at snd_power_ref_and_wait() in   snd_ctl_info() or read/write() inside card->controls_rwsem.  * The system gets disconnected meanwhile and the driver tries to   delete a kctl via snd_ctl_remove*(); it tries to take   card->controls_rwsem again but this is already locked by the   above.  Since the sleeper isn't woken up this deadlocks.  An easy fix is to wake up sleepers before processing the driver disconnect callbacks but right after setting the card->shutdown flag. Then all sleepers will abort immediately and the code flows again.  So basically this patch moves the wait_event() call at the right timing.  While we're at it just to be sure call wait_event_all() instead of wait_event() although we don't use exclusive events on this queue for now.,5.5,CWE-667
