CVE-2023-40177,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can use the content field of their user profile page to execute arbitrary scripts with programming rights thus effectively performing rights escalation. This issue is present since version 4.3M2 when AppWithinMinutes Application added support for the Content field allowing any wiki page (including the user profile page) to use its content as an AWM Content field which has a custom displayer that executes the content with the rights of the ``AppWithinMinutes.Content`` author rather than the rights of the content author. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1. The fix is in the content of the AppWithinMinutes.Content page that defines the custom displayer. By using the ``display`` script service to render the content we make sure that the proper author is used for access rights checks.,9.9,CWE-95

CVE-2024-53150,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out of bounds reads when finding clock sources  The current USB-audio driver code doesn't check bLength of each descriptor at traversing for clock descriptors.  That is when a device provides a bogus descriptor with a shorter bLength the driver might hit out-of-bounds reads.  For addressing it this patch adds sanity checks to the validator functions for the clock descriptor traversal.  When the descriptor length is shorter than expected it's skipped in the loop.  For the clock source and clock multiplier descriptors we can just check bLength against the sizeof() of each descriptor type. OTOH the clock selector descriptor of UAC2 and UAC3 has an array of bNrInPins elements and two more fields at its tail hence those have to be checked in addition to the sizeof() check.,7.1,CWE-125

This fixes a possible null-pointer dereference as created_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists since it is updated at the very beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU.  created_vcpus exists to allow the bulk of vCPU creation to run in parallel while still correctly restricting the max number of max vCPUs.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-29238,Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. Prior to version 6.4.12 authenticated requests to the notebook server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing the contents of hidden directories not accessing individual hidden files or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to be disallowed. Because fully authenticated requests are required this is of relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitive files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh` while serving $HOME) then any authenticated requests could access files if their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access to the server and therefore execution permissions which also generally grants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result in any privilege escalation or increase in information access only an additional unintended means by which the files could be accessed. Version 6.4.12 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.,4.3,CWE-425

CVE-2022-36006,Arvados is an open source platform for managing processing and sharing genomic and other large scientific and biomedical data. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Arvados Workbench allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. This exists in all versions up to 2.4.1 and is fixed in 2.4.2. This vulnerability is specific to the Ruby on Rails Workbench application (“Workbench 1”). We do not believe any other Arvados components including the TypesScript browser-based Workbench application (“Workbench 2”) or API Server are vulnerable to this attack. For versions of Arvados earlier than 2.4.2: remove the Ruby-based Workbench 1 app (apt-get remove arvados-workbench) from your installation as a workaround.,7.9,CWE-94

CVE-2025-59044,Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Himmelblau 0.9.x derives numeric GIDs for Entra ID groups from the group display name when himmelblau.conf `id_attr_map = name` (the default configuration). Because Microsoft Entra ID allows multiple groups with the same `displayName` (including end-user–created personal/O365 groups depending on tenant policy) distinct directory groups can collapse to the same numeric GID on Linux. This issue only applies to Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.22. Any resource or service on a Himmelblau-joined host that enforces authorization by numeric GID (files/dirs etc.) can be unintentionally accessible to a user who creates or joins a different Entra/O365 group that happens to share the same `displayName` as a privileged security group. Users should upgrade to 0.9.23 or 1.0.0 or later to receive a patch. Group to GID mapping now uses Entra ID object IDs (GUIDs) and does not collide on same-name groups. As a workaround use tenant policy hardening to restrict arbitrary group creation until all hosts are patched.,4.4,CWE-1188

CVE-2021-47183,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference  If an FC link down transition while PLOGIs are outstanding to fabric well known addresses outstanding ABTS requests may result in a NULL pointer dereference. Driver unload requests may hang with repeated 2878 log messages.  The Link down processing results in ABTS requests for outstanding ELS requests. The Abort WQEs are sent for the ELSs before the driver had set the link state to down. Thus the driver is sending the Abort with the expectation that an ABTS will be sent on the wire. The Abort request is stalled waiting for the link to come up. In some conditions the driver may auto-complete the ELSs thus if the link does come up the Abort completions may reference an invalid structure.  Fix by ensuring that Abort set the flag to avoid link traffic if issued due to conditions where the link failed.,5.5,CWE-476
