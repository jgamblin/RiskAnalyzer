CVE-2023-26484,KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In versions 0.59.0 and prior if a malicious user has taken over a Kubernetes node where virt-handler (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is running the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs. This can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged components which can for instance read all secrets on the cluster or can exec into pods on other nodes. This way a compromised node can be used to elevate privileges beyond the node until potentially having full privileged access to the whole cluster. The simplest way to exploit this once a user could compromise a specific node is to set with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on its node. No patches are available as of time of publication. As a workaround gatekeeper users can add a webhook which will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify the spec of a node.,8.2,CWE-863

CVE-2024-35895,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem  syzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes elements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be invoked from any interrupt context locks taken during a map_delete_elem operation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion is possible as reported by lockdep:         CPU0                    CPU1        ----                    ----   lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);                                local_irq_disable();                                lock(&host->lock);                                lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);   <Interrupt>     lock(&host->lock);  Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be deleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts enabled or in softirq context.  Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is _not_ hardirq-unsafe that is interrupts are disabled and bail out with an error.  Note that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does not allow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-30095,VyOS 1.3 through 1.5 (fixed in 1.4.2) or any Debian-based system using dropbear in combination with live-build has the same Dropbear private host keys across different installations. Thus an attacker can conduct active man-in-the-middle attacks against SSH connections if Dropbear is enabled as the SSH daemon. I n VyOS this is not the default configuration for the system SSH daemon but is for the console service. To mitigate this one can run rm -f /etc/dropbear/*key* and/or rm -f /etc/dropbear-initramfs/*key* and then dropbearkey -t rsa -s 4096 -f /etc/dropbear_rsa_host_key and reload the service or reboot the system before using Dropbear as the SSH daemon (this clears out all keys mistakenly built into the release image) or update to the latest version of VyOS 1.4 or 1.5. Note that this vulnerability is not unique to VyOS and may appear in any Debian-based Linux distribution that uses Dropbear in combination with live-build which has a safeguard against this behavior in OpenSSH but no equivalent one for Dropbear.,9.0,CWE-321

CVE-2022-42889,Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is ${prefix:name} where prefix is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9 the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are: - script - execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) - dns - resolve dns records - url - load values from urls including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used.

CVE-2023-44387,Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When copying or archiving symlinked files Gradle resolves them but applies the permissions of the symlink itself instead of the permissions of the linked file to the resulting file. This leads to files having too much permissions given that symlinks usually are world readable and writeable. While it is unlikely this results in a direct vulnerability for the impacted build it may open up attack vectors depending on where build artifacts end up being copied to or un-archived. In versions 7.6.3 8.4 and above Gradle will now properly use the permissions of the file pointed at by the symlink to set permissions of the copied or archived file.,3.2,CWE-732

CVE-2024-25622,h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The configuration directives provided by the headers handler allows users to modify the response headers being sent by h2o. The configuration file of h2o has scopes and the inner scopes (e.g. path level) are expected to inherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g. global level). However if a header directive is used in the inner scope all the definition in outer scopes are ignored. This can lead to headers not being modified as expected. Depending on the headers being added or removed unexpectedly this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior.

CVE-2024-41066,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak  Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during transmit:     tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;     free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;     consumer_index ++; Where variable data looks like this:     free_map == [4 IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP 0 3]                                                	consumer_index^     tx_buff == [skb=null skb=<ptr> skb=<ptr> skb=null skb=null]  The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed to an unused/null skb address. So if by some chance our free_map and tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop sending packets eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.  Therefore add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-36114,Aircompressor is a library with ports of the Snappy LZO LZ4 and Zstandard compression algorithms to Java. All decompressor implementations of Aircompressor (LZ4 LZO Snappy Zstandard) can crash the JVM for certain input and in some cases also leak the content of other memory of the Java process (which could contain sensitive information). When decompressing certain data the decompressors try to access memory outside the bounds of the given byte arrays or byte buffers. Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++ namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed. When decompressing data from untrusted users this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM or to leak other sensitive information from the Java process. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,8.6,CWE-125

CVE-2024-22417,Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions 0.8.3 and prior the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes them to the `send` method which sends a `GET` request on lines 339-343 in `requests.py`. The returned contents of the URL are then passed to and reflected back to the user in the `send_file` function on line 484 together with the user-controlled `src_type` which allows the attacker to control the HTTP response content type leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker could craft a special URL to point to a malicious website and send the link to a victim. The fact that the link would contain a trusted domain (e.g. from one of public Whoogle instances) could be used to trick the user into clicking the link.
