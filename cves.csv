CVE-2023-0011,A flaw in the input validation in TOBY-L2 allows a user to execute arbitrary operating system commands using specifically crafted AT commands. This vulnerability requires physical access to the serial interface of the module or the ability to modify the system or software which uses its serial interface to send malicious AT commands.     Exploitation of the vulnerability gives full administrative (root) privileges to the attacker to execute any operating system command on TOBY-L2 which can lead to modification of the behavior of the module itself as well as the components connected with it (depending on its rights on other connected systems). It can further provide the ability to read system level files and hamper the availability of the module as well..     This issue affects TOBY-L2 series: TOBY-L200 TOBY-L201 TOBY-L210 TOBY-L220 TOBY-L280.  ,7.6,CWE-20

CVE-2022-29254,silverstripe-omnipay is a SilverStripe integration with Omnipay PHP payments library. For a subset of Omnipay gateways (those that use intermediary states like `isNotification()` or `isRedirect()`) if the payment identifier or success URL is exposed it is possible for payments to be prematurely marked as completed without payment being taken. This is mitigated by the fact that most payment gateways hide this information from users however some issuing banks offer flawed 3DSecure implementations that may inadvertently expose this data.

In versions prior to 0.5.3 the `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` methods fail to use sufficiently random values. The initial value to seed the PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) is baked-in to the final WebAssembly module making the sequence of random values for that specific WebAssembly module predictable. An attacker can use the fixed seed to predict random numbers generated by these functions and bypass cryptographic security controls for example to disclose sensitive data encrypted by functions that use these generators. The problem has been patched in version 0.5.3. No known workarounds exist.,7.5,CWE-335
CVE-2024-34698,FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions of FreeScout prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters Parsing) without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key `__proto__` along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself. As a result the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in an unsafe way this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS Open Redirection Cookie Manipulation Link Manipulation HTML Injection etc. Version 1.8.139 contains a patch for the issue.,4.6,CWE-1321

CVE-2024-20330,A vulnerability in the Snort 2 and Snort 3 TCP and UDP detection engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause memory corruption which could cause the Snort detection engine to restart unexpectedly.    This vulnerability is due to improper memory management when the Snort detection engine processes specific TCP or UDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP or UDP packets through a device that is inspecting traffic using the Snort detection engine. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to restart the Snort detection engine repeatedly which could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The DoS condition impacts only the traffic through the device that is examined by the Snort detection engine. The device can still be managed over the network.  Note: Once a memory block is corrupted it cannot be cleared until the Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliance is manually reloaded. This means that the Snort detection engine could crash repeatedly causing traffic that is processed by the Snort detection engine to be dropped until the device is manually reloaded.,8.6,CWE-788

CVE-2021-47389,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: fix missing sev_decommission in sev_receive_start  DECOMMISSION the current SEV context if binding an ASID fails after RECEIVE_START.  Per AMD's SEV API RECEIVE_START generates a new guest context and thus needs to be paired with DECOMMISSION:       The RECEIVE_START command is the only command other than the LAUNCH_START      command that generates a new guest context and guest handle.  The missing DECOMMISSION can result in subsequent SEV launch failures as the firmware leaks memory and might not able to allocate more SEV guest contexts in the future.  Note LAUNCH_START suffered the same bug but was previously fixed by commit 934002cd660b (KVM: SVM: Call SEV Guest Decommission if ASID binding fails).,5.1,CWE-772

CVE-2025-27610,Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13 3.0.14 and 3.1.12 `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13 3.0.14 and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static` or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.,7.5,CWE-23
CVE-2023-20006,A vulnerability in the hardware-based SSL/TLS cryptography functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.    This vulnerability is due to an implementation error within the cryptographic functions for SSL/TLS traffic processing when they are offloaded to the hardware.

CVE-2022-30314,Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager 5.02 uses Hard-coded Credentials. According to FSCT-2022-0052 there is a Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager hardcoded credentials issue. The affected components are characterized as: POLO bootloader. The potential impact is: Manipulate firmware. The Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager utilizes the DCOM-232/485 serial interface for firmware management purposes. When booting the Safety Manager exposes the Enea POLO bootloader via this interface. Access to the boot configuration is controlled by means of credentials hardcoded in the Safety Manager firmware. The credentials for the bootloader are hardcoded in the firmware. An attacker with access to the serial interface (either through physical access a compromised EWS or an exposed serial-to-ethernet gateway) can utilize these credentials to control the boot process and manipulate the unauthenticated firmware image (see FSCT-2022-0054).,4.6,CWE-798

CVE-2024-35827,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()  The controllen variable is type size_t (unsigned long).  Casting it to int could lead to an integer underflow.  The check_add_overflow() function considers the type of the destination which is type int.  If we add two positive values and the result cannot fit in an integer then that's counted as an overflow.  However if we cast controllen to an int and it turns negative then negative values *can* fit into an int type so there is no overflow.  Good: 100 + (unsigned long)-4 = 96  <-- overflow  Bad: 100 + (int)-4 = 96 <-- no overflow  I deleted the cast of the sizeof() as well.  That's not a bug but the cast is unnecessary.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2023-35926,Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals.
