CVE-2024-26654,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs  The dreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard->timer.  When the snd_pcm_substream is closing the aica_channel will be deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:        (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2) snd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |  ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker                                  |    mod_timer()   flush_work()                   |   del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer   kfree(dreamcastcard->channel)  |    schedule_work()                                  |  run_spu_dma() //worker   ...                            |    dreamcastcard->channel-> //USE  In order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases call mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma() then implement PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop op will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.,7.0,CWE-416

CVE-2022-24900,Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the malicious parameter represents an absolute path the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.,9.9,CWE-22

CVE-2023-52638,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock  The following 3 locks would race against each other causing the deadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:  - j1939_socks_lock - active_session_list_lock - sk_session_queue_lock  A reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock since in the rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list that j1939_socks_lock is protecting the code does not attempt to acquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency where for example the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock and attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock and at the same time another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding sk_session_queue_lock.  NOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug reported by Syzbot; instead it solves a deadlock situation to prepare for one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug which appears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.

CVE-2024-46845,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing/timerlat: Only clear timer if a kthread exists  The timerlat tracer can use user space threads to check for osnoise and timer latency. If the program using this is killed via a SIGTERM the threads are shutdown one at a time and another tracing instance can start up resetting the threads before they are fully closed. That causes the hrtimer assigned to the kthread to be shutdown and freed twice when the dying thread finally closes the file descriptors causing a use-after-free bug.  Only cancel the hrtimer if the associated thread is still around. Also add the interface_lock around the resetting of the tlat_var->kthread.  Note this is just a quick fix that can be backported to stable. A real fix is to have a better synchronization between the shutdown of old threads and the starting of new ones.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-46850,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn35_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()  dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe context passed to dcn35_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.  If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which calls dcn35_set_drr() at some point) we can end up using already nulled function callback fields of struct stream_resource.  The logic in dcn35_set_drr() already tries to avoid this by checking tg against NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and before the next access then we get a race.  Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable and then use this variable for all the operations. This should work as long as nobody frees the resource pool where the timing generators live.

CVE-2023-38292,Certain software builds for the TCL 20XE Android device contain a vulnerable pre-installed app with a package name of com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy (versionCode='2' versionName='v11.0.1.0.0201.0') that allows local third-party apps to programmatically perform a factory reset due to inadequate access control. No permissions or special privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerability in the com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy app. No user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable build are as follows: TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO:11/RP1A.200720.011/PB7I-0:user/release-keys and TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO:11/RP1A.200720.011/PB83-0:user/release-keys. This malicious app sends a broadcast intent to the exported com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy/.rtn.FactoryResetReceiver receiver component which initiates a programmatic factory reset.,8.7,CWE-269
CVE-2023-25745,Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 109. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 110.,8.8,CWE-787
CVE-2023-48505,Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.18 and earlier are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be abused by a low-privileged attacker to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable form fields. Malicious JavaScript may be executed in a victim’s browser when they browse to the page containing the vulnerable field.,5.4,CWE-79
CVE-2022-35943,Shield is an authentication and authorization framework for CodeIgniter 4. This vulnerability may allow [SameSite Attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the [CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.html) mechanism with CodeIgniter Shield. For this attack to succeed the attacker must have direct (or indirect e.g. XSS) control over a subdomain site (e.g. `https://a.example.com/`) of the target site (e.g. `http://example.com/`). Upgrade to **CodeIgniter v4.2.3 or later** and **Shield v1.0.0-beta.2 or later**. As a workaround: set `Config\Security::$csrfProtection` to `'session'`remove old session data right after login (immediately after ID and password match) and regenerate CSRF token right after login (immediately after ID and password match),5.9,CWE-352
CVE-2023-20507,An integer overflow in the ASP could allow a privileged attacker to perform an out-of-bounds write potentially resulting in loss of data integrity.,2.3,CWE-190
CVE-2023-28320,A denial of service vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in the way libcurl provides several different backends for resolving host names selected at build time. If it is built to use the synchronous resolver it allows name resolves to time-out slow operations using `alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`. When doing this libcurl used a global buffer that was not mutex protected and a multi-threaded application might therefore crash or otherwise misbehave.,5.9,CWE-400
