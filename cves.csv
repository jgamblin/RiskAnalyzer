Fix this by denying any operation on devices being unregistered. A check was already there in ethnl_ops_begin but not wide enough.  Note that the same issue cannot be seen on the ioctl version (__dev_ethtool) because the device reference is retrieved from within the rtnl lock section there.

CVE-2023-38505,DietPi-Dashboard is a web dashboard for the operating system DietPi. The dashboard only allows for one TLS handshake to be in process at a given moment. Once a TCP connection is established in HTTPS mode it will assume that it should be waiting for a handshake and will stay this way indefinitely until a handshake starts or some error occurs. In version 0.6.1 this can be exploited by simply not starting the handshake preventing any other TLS handshakes from getting through. An attacker can lock the dashboard in a state where it is waiting for a TLS handshake from the attacker who won't provide it. This prevents any legitimate traffic from getting to the dashboard and can last indefinitely. Version 0.6.2 has a patch for this issue. As a workaround do not use HTTPS mode on the open internet where anyone can connect. Instead put a reverse proxy in front of the dashboard and have it handle any HTTPS connections.,7.5,CWE-410

CVE-2025-21638,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: sysctl: auth_enable: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only   from the opener's netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases resulting in an 'Oops'   (null-ptr-deref) e.g. when the current task is exiting as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).

CVE-2022-29245,SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1 during an `X25519` key exchange the client’s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host during the X25519 key exchange the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.,6.5,CWE-338

CVE-2024-42102,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits() again  Patch series mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling.  Dirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into 32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for more details).   This patch (of 2):  This reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.  The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly the removed (u64) cast from the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit archs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh >= 1<<32 (which is actually common - the default settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly the div64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have div64_ul() in case we want to be safe & cheap.  Thirdly if dirty thresholds are larger than 1<<32 pages then dirty balancing is going to blow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one possible overflow is just moot.,4.7,CWE-369

CVE-2024-39476,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid5: fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING  Xiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with small possibility the root cause is exactly the same as commit bed9e27baf52 (Revert md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d)  However Dan reported another hang after that and junxiao investigated the problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio can't issue from raid5d().  Current implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence:  1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold 'reconfig_mutex' to clear    MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING; 2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop until all IO are issued; 3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;  This behaviour is introduce before v2.6 and for consequence if other context hold 'reconfig_mutex' and md_check_recovery() can't update super_block then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop until 'reconfig_mutex' is released.  Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10 fix this problem by skipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after md_check_recovery() daemon thread will be woken up when 'reconfig_mutex' is released. Meanwhile the hang problem will be fixed as well.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2022-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()  On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space the ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs even though the CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the file the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to wake waiters as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.  While debugging this I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is OK to do) and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is not fine and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).

CVE-2023-41890,Sustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support to ASP.NET web sites allowing the web site to act as a SAML2 Service Provider.  Prior to versions 1.0.3 and 2.9.2 when a response is processed the issuer of the Identity Provider is not sufficiently validated. This could allow a malicious identity provider to craft a Saml2 response that is processed as if issued by another identity provider. It is also possible for a malicious end user to cause stored state intended for one identity provider to be used when processing the response from another provider. An application is impacted if they rely on any of these features in their authentication/authorization logic: the issuer of the generated identity and claims; or items in the stored request state (AuthenticationProperties). This issue is patched in versions 2.9.2 and 1.0.3. The `AcsCommandResultCreated` notification can be used to add the validation required if an upgrade to patched packages is not possible.,7.5,CWE-289

CVE-2024-22422,AnythingLLM is an application that turns any document resource or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as references during chatting. In versions prior to commit `08d33cfd8` an unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack. The “data-export” endpoint is used to export files using the filename parameter as user input. The endpoint takes the user input filters it to avoid directory traversal attacks fetches the file from the server and afterwards deletes it. An attacker can trick the input filter mechanism to point to the current directory and while attempting to delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper around it. Moreover the endpoint is public and does not require any form of authentication resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of Service issue which crashes the instance using a single HTTP packet. This issue has been addressed in commit `08d33cfd8`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.5,CWE-754

CVE-2022-39335,Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix Federation API allows remote homeservers to request the authorization events in a room. This is necessary so that a homeserver receiving some events can validate that those events are legitimate and permitted in their room. However in versions of Synapse up to and including 1.68.0 a Synapse homeserver answering a query for authorization events does not sufficiently check that the requesting server should be able to access them. The issue was patched in Synapse 1.69.0. Homeserver administrators are advised to upgrade.,5.0,CWE-200
CVE-2024-48985,An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets the software dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet data. A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet the size of which is calculated as the length of the packet body determined earlier and the header length. If the allocate fails because the specified packet is too large no exception handling occurs and hciTrSerialRxIncoming continues to write bytes into the 4-byte large temporary header buffer leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to the buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body but which couldn't be allocated. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which step of the parsing process is currently being executed. This advances the function to the next state where it proceeds to copy data to that arbitrary location. The packet body is then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.,7.5,CWE-120
