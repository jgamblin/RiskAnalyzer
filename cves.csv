CVE-2025-47939,TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. By design the file management module in TYPO3’s backend user interface has historically allowed the upload of any file type with the exception of those that are directly executable in a web server context. This lack of restriction means it is possible to upload files that may be considered potentially harmful such as executable binaries (e.g. `.exe` files) or files with inconsistent file extensions and MIME types (for example a file incorrectly named with a `.png` extension but actually carrying the MIME type `application/zip`) starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.51 ELTS 10.4.50 ELTS 11.5.44 ELTS 12.4.31 LTS and 13.4.12 LTS. Although such files are not directly executable through the web server their presence can introduce indirect risks. For example third-party services such as antivirus scanners or malware detection systems might flag or block access to the website for end users if suspicious files are found. This could negatively affect the availability or reputation of the site. Users should update to TYPO3 version 9.5.51 ELTS 10.4.50 ELTS 11.5.44 ELTS 12.4.31 LTS or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem.,5.4,CWE-351

CVE-2022-3204,A vulnerability named 'Non-Responsive Delegation Attack' (NRDelegation Attack) has been discovered in various DNS resolving software. The NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a considerable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts by querying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive nameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can trigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually look in the cache for resolved NS records in that delegation. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in orchestrated attacks. Unbound does not suffer from high CPU usage but resources are still needed for resolving the malicious delegation. Unbound will keep trying to resolve the record until hard limits are reached. Based on the nature of the attack and the replies different limits could be reached. From version 1.16.3 on Unbound introduces fixes for better performance when under load by cutting opportunistic queries for nameserver discovery and DNSKEY prefetching and limiting the number of times a delegation point can issue a cache lookup for missing records.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2022-28382,An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook aka ECB) an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g. AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data in this case blocks of 16 bytes to identical ciphertext data. For some data for instance bitmap images the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion within ECB can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk even in an encrypted form. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part Number #49428 Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD GD25LK01-3637-C VER4.0 Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1 and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.,7.5,CWE-327

CVE-2023-0286,There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.  When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag) this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point which is uncommon. As such this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.,7.4,CWE-843

Ability to overwrite code space with remote code. Fixed in commit https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility/commit/1129147c38ac02ad974c4c701a1e01b2141b9fe2.,6.0,CWE-120
CVE-2022-40145,This vulnerable is about a potential code injection when an attacker has control of the target LDAP server using in the JDBC JNDI URL.  The function jaas.modules.src.main.java.porg.apache.karaf.jass.modules.jdbc.JDBCUtils#doCreateDatasource use InitialContext.lookup(jndiName) without filtering. An user can modify `options.put(JDBCUtils.DATASOURCE osgi: + DataSource.class.getName());` to `options.put(JDBCUtils.DATASOURCEjndi:rmi://x.x.x.x:xxxx/Command);` in JdbcLoginModuleTest#setup.  This is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack when a configuration uses a JNDI LDAP data source URI when an attacker has control of the target LDAP server.This issue affects all versions of Apache Karaf up to 4.4.1 and 4.3.7.
