CVE-2022-31113,Canarytokens is an open source tool which helps track activity and actions on your network. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens. This permits an attacker who recognised an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the Canarytoken's creator. This vulnerability could be used to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken or view its activation history. It might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing more information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For example an attacker could recover the email address tied to the Canarytoken or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the creator's network location. An attacker could only act on the discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens or other Canarytoken creators. The issue has been patched on Canarytokens.org and in the latest release. No signs of successful exploitation of this vulnerability have been found. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,6.3,CWE-79

CVE-2022-49622,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables: avoid skb access on nf_stolen  When verdict is NF_STOLEN the skb might have been freed.  When tracing is enabled this can result in a use-after-free: 1. access to skb->nf_trace 2. access to skb->mark 3. computation of trace id 4. dump of packet payload  To avoid 1 keep a cached copy of skb->nf_trace in the trace state struct.

CVE-2024-35955,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kprobes: Fix possible use-after-free issue on kprobe registration  When unloading a module its state is changing MODULE_STATE_LIVE ->  MODULE_STATE_GOING -> MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. Each change will take a time. `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()` works with MODULE_STATE_LIVE and MODULE_STATE_GOING. If we use `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()` separately there is a chance that the first one is succeeded but the next one is failed because module->state becomes MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED between those operations.  In `check_kprobe_address_safe()` if the second `__module_text_address()` is failed that is ignored because it expected a kernel_text address. But it may have failed simply because module->state has been changed to MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. In this case arm_kprobe() will try to modify non-exist module text address (use-after-free).  To fix this problem we should not use separated `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()` but use only `__module_text_address()` once and do `try_module_get(module)` which is only available with MODULE_STATE_LIVE.,8.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-56138,notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature. During the timestamp signature generation the revocation status of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp signature generation notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised intermediate or revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature which would then be accepted and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service scenarios particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.0,CWE-299
CVE-2022-47631,Razer Synapse through 3.7.1209.121307 allows privilege escalation due to an unsafe installation path and improper privilege management. Attackers can place DLLs into %PROGRAMDATA%\Razer\Synapse3\Service\bin if they do so before the service is installed and if they deny write access for the SYSTEM user. Although the service will not start if it detects malicious DLLs in this directory attackers can exploit a race condition and replace a valid DLL (i.e. a copy of a legitimate Razer DLL) with a malicious DLL after the service has already checked the file. As a result local Windows users can abuse the Razer driver installer to obtain administrative privileges on Windows.,7.8,CWE-367

CVE-2022-33891,The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might then be able to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution as the user Spark is currently running as.

CVE-2025-21788,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases  If the XDP program doesn't result in XDP_PASS then we leak the memory allocated by am65_cpsw_build_skb().  It is pointless to allocate SKB memory before running the XDP program as we would be wasting CPU cycles for cases other than XDP_PASS. Move the SKB allocation after evaluating the XDP program result.  This fixes the memleak. A performance boost is seen for XDP_DROP test.  XDP_DROP test: Before: 460256 rx/s                  0 err/s After:  784130 rx/s                  0 err/s,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2022-39257,Matrix iOS SDK allows developers to build iOS apps compatible with Matrix. Prior to version 0.23.19 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-ios-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy. The default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19. matrix-ios-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example by showing a warning for such messages). This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.,7.5,CWE-287

CVE-2024-25124,Fiber is a web framework written in go. Prior to version 2.52.1 the CORS middleware allows for insecure configurations that could potentially expose the application to multiple CORS-related vulnerabilities. Specifically it allows setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to a wildcard (`*`) while also having the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true which goes against recommended security best practices. The impact of this misconfiguration is high as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data and expose the system to various types of attacks listed in the PortSwigger article linked in the references. Version 2.52.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround users may manually validate the CORS configurations in their implementation to ensure that they do not allow a wildcard origin when credentials are enabled. The browser fetch api as well as browsers and utilities that enforce CORS policies are not affected by this.,9.4,CWE-346
