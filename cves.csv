CVE-2025-2787,KNIME Business Hub is affected by the Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974 ( a.k.a IngressNightmare ) vulnerability which affects the ingress-nginx component. In the worst case a complete takeover of the Kubernetes cluster is possible. Since the affected component is only reachable from within the cluster i.e. requires an authenticated user the severity in the context of KNIME Business Hub is slightly lower.    Besides applying the publicly known workarounds we strongly recommend updating to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub:       *  1.13.3 or above          *  1.12.4 or above          *  1.11.4 or above          *  1.10.4 or above           *,8.8,CWE-94

CVE-2025-24015,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. Versions 1.46.0 through 2.1.6 have an issue that affects AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM in Deno in which the authentication tag is not being validated. This means tampered ciphertexts or incorrect keys might not be detected which breaks the guarantees expected from AES-GCM. Older versions of Deno correctly threw errors in such cases as does Node.js. Without authentication tag verification AES-GCM degrades to essentially CTR mode removing integrity protection. Authenticated data set with set_aad is also affected as it is incorporated into the GCM hash (ghash) but this too is not validated rendering AAD checks ineffective. Version 2.1.7 includes a patch that addresses this issue.,5.3,CWE-347
CVE-2021-34971,Foxit PDF Reader JPG2000 File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-14812.,7.8,CWE-122
CVE-2024-50145,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()  build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.  __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb allocation fails keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case don't process the packets and don't push them up the network stack - they are skipped.  Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-40027,Keystone is an open source headless CMS for Node.js — built with GraphQL and React. When `ui.isAccessAllowed` is set as `undefined` the `adminMeta` GraphQL query is publicly accessible (no session required). This is different to the behaviour of the default AdminUI middleware which by default will only be publicly accessible (no session required) if a `session` strategy is not defined. This vulnerability does not affect developers using the `@keystone-6/auth` package or any users that have written their own `ui.isAccessAllowed` (that is to say `isAccessAllowed` is not `undefined`). This vulnerability does affect users who believed that their `session` strategy will by default enforce that `adminMeta` is inaccessible by the public in accordance with that strategy; akin to the behaviour of the AdminUI middleware. This vulnerability has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version `5.5.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may opt to write their own `isAccessAllowed` functionality to work-around this vulnerability.,3.7,CWE-862

CVE-2024-28864,SecureProps is a PHP library designed to simplify the encryption and decryption of property data in objects. A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher` and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.,2.6,CWE-1333

CVE-2024-1635,A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point depending on the amount of memory available.     At HTTP upgrade to remoting the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task the whole dependency tree leaks via that task which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit which contains the connections and causes the leak.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2024-31214,Traccar is an open source GPS tracking system. Traccar versions 5.1 through 5.12 allow arbitrary files to be uploaded through the device image upload API. Attackers have full control over the file contents full control over the directory where the file is stored full control over the file extension and partial control over the file name. While it's not  for an attacker to overwrite an existing file an attacker can create new files with certain names and attacker-controlled extensions anywhere on the file system. This can potentially lead to remote code execution XSS DOS etc. The default install of Traccar makes this vulnerability more severe. Self-registration is enabled by default allowing anyone to create an account to exploit this vulnerability. Traccar also runs by default with root/system privileges allowing files to be placed anywhere on the file system. Version 6.0 contains a fix for the issue. One may also turn off self-registration by default as that would make most vulnerabilities in the application much harder to exploit by default and reduce the severity considerably. ,9.6,CWE-434
CVE-2024-20318,A vulnerability in the Layer 2 Ethernet services of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause the line card network processor to reset resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
