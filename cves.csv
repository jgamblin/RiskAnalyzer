CVE-2023-52517,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drain  Previously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to read any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is correct when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the transfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be transferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO still needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure and DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO corrupting any data read. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never adjusted according to DMA progress in DMA mode thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA mode is a bug. Fix corruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode. Also wait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to ensure all data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.,7.0,CWE-362

For example using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources instead then some users that shouldn't have access may. Generally `LookupResources` is not and should not be to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since its initial release. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.22.2. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions.,3.7,CWE-913

CVE-2021-47205,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbinding  Currently unbinding a CCU driver unmaps the device's MMIO region while leaving its clocks/resets and their providers registered. This can cause a page fault later when some clock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fix this by separating the CCU initialization from the memory allocation and then using a devres callback to unregister the clocks and resets.  This also fixes a memory leak of the `struct ccu_reset` and uses the correct owner (the specific platform driver) for the clocks and resets.  Early OF clock providers are never unregistered and limited error handling is possible so they are mostly unchanged. The error reporting is made more consistent by moving the message inside of_sunxi_ccu_probe.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2022-48892,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/core: Fix use-after-free bug in dup_user_cpus_ptr()  Since commit 07ec77a1d4e8 (sched: Allow task CPU affinity to be restricted on asymmetric systems) the setting and clearing of user_cpus_ptr are done under pi_lock for arm64 architecture. However dup_user_cpus_ptr() accesses user_cpus_ptr without any lock protection. Since sched_setaffinity() can be invoked from another process the process being modified may be undergoing fork() at the same time.  When racing with the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in __set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked() it can lead to user-after-free and possibly double-free in arm64 kernel.  Commit 8f9ea86fdf99 (sched: Always preserve the user requested cpumask) fixes this problem as user_cpus_ptr once set will never be cleared in a task's lifetime. However this bug was re-introduced in commit 851a723e45d1 (sched: Always clear user_cpus_ptr in do_set_cpus_allowed()) which allows the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in do_set_cpus_allowed(). This time it will affect all arches.  Fix this bug by always clearing the user_cpus_ptr of the newly cloned/forked task before the copying process starts and check the user_cpus_ptr state of the source task under pi_lock.  Note to stable this patch won't be applicable to stable releases. Just copy the new dup_user_cpus_ptr() function over.,7.8,CWE-415

CVE-2022-24815,JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate develop & deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures. SQL Injection vulnerability in entities for applications generated with the option reactive with Spring WebFlux enabled and an SQL database using r2dbc. Applications created without reactive with Spring WebFlux and applications with NoSQL databases are not affected. Users who have generated a microservice Gateway using the affected version may be impacted as Gateways are reactive by default.

CVE-2022-28382,An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook aka ECB) an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g. AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data in this case blocks of 16 bytes to identical ciphertext data. For some data for instance bitmap images the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion within ECB can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk even in an encrypted form.

CVE-2024-23330,Tuta is an encrypted email service. In versions prior to 119.10 an attacker can attach an image in a html mail which is loaded from external resource in the default setting which should prevent loading of external resources. When displaying emails containing external content they should be loaded by default only after confirmation by the user. However it could be recognized that certain embedded images (see PoC) are loaded even though the Automatic Reloading of Images function is disabled by default. The reloading is also done unencrypted via HTTP and redirections are followed. This behavior is unexpected for the user since the user assumes that external content will only be loaded after explicit manual confirmation. The loading of external content in e-mails represents a risk because this makes the sender aware that the e-mail address is used when the e-mail was read which device is used and expose the user's IP address. Version 119.10 contains a patch for this issue.,5.3,CWE-918

CVE-2025-32874,An issue was discovered in Kaseya Rapid Fire Tools Network Detective through 2.0.16.0. A vulnerability exists in the EncryptionUtil class because symmetric encryption is implemented in a deterministic and non-randomized fashion.

As a result identical plaintext inputs always produce identical ciphertext outputs. This is true for both FIPS and non-FIPS generated passwords. In other words there is a cryptographic implementation flaw in the password encryption mechanism. Although there are multiple encryption methods grouped under FIPS and non-FIPS classifications the logic consistently results in predictable and reversible encrypted outputs due to the lack of per-operation randomness and encryption authentication.,7.4,CWE-311
