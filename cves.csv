CVE-2023-50926,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read can be caused by an incoming DIO message when using the RPL-Lite implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system. More specifically the prefix information of the DIO message contains a field that specifies the length of an IPv6 address prefix. The value of this field is not validated which means that an attacker can set a value that is longer than the maximum prefix length. Subsequently a memcmp function call that compares different prefixes can be called with a length argument that surpasses the boundary of the array allocated for the prefix causing an out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in the next release. Users are advised to update as soon as they are able to or to manually apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2721.,7.5,CWE-125

CVE-2023-29529,matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call is taking place can eavesdrop on the video and audio of participants using matrix-js-sdk without their knowledge. To affected matrix-js-sdk users the attacker will not appear to be participating in the call. This attack is possible because matrix-js-sdk's group call implementation accepts incoming direct calls from other users even if they have not yet declared intent to participate in the group call as a means of resolving a race condition in call setup. Affected versions do not restrict access to the user's outbound media in this case. Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. This is fixed in matrix-js-sdk 24.1.0. As a workaround users may hold group calls in private rooms where only the exact users who are expected to participate in the call are present.,5.0,CWE-862
CVE-2023-46129,NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology built for the cloud on-premise IoT and edge computing. The cryptographic key handling library nkeys recently gained support for encryption not just for signing/authentication. This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys versions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5 corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3 the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handling logic mistakenly passed an array by value into an internal function where the function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. As a result all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects encryption only not signing.   FIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTH CALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys Go library 0.4.6 corresponding with NATS Server 2.10.4 has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. For any application handling auth callouts in Go if using the nkeys library update the dependency recompile and deploy that in lockstep.,7.5,CWE-321

CVE-2024-26814,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/fsl-mc: Block calling interrupt handler without trigger  The eventfd_ctx trigger pointer of the vfio_fsl_mc_irq object is initially NULL and may become NULL if the user sets the trigger eventfd to -1.  The interrupt handler itself is guaranteed that trigger is always valid between request_irq() and free_irq() but the loopback testing mechanisms to invoke the handler function need to test the trigger.  The triggering and setting ioctl paths both make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.  The vfio-fsl-mc driver does not make use of irqfds nor does it support any sort of masking operations therefore unlike vfio-pci and vfio-platform the flow can remain essentially unchanged.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-21744,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()  On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL pointer dereference occurs.  The following sequence deletes the interface:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_remove_interface()       brcmf_del_if()  Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.  After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is called providing the following sequence:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_proto_detach()       brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()         brcmf_flowring_detach()           brcmf_msgbuf_delete_flowring()             brcmf_msgbuf_remove_flowring()               brcmf_flowring_delete()                 brcmf_get_ifp()                 brcmf_txfinalize()  Since brcmf_get_ip() can and actually will return NULL in this case the call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.  This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.  Although the NULL pointer dereference has only been seen when trying to update the tx statistic all other uses of the ifp pointer have been guarded as well with an early return if ifp is NULL.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-29164,Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. In affected versions an attacker can create a workflow which produces a HTML artifact containing an HTML file that contains a script which uses XHR calls to interact with the Argo Server API. The attacker emails the deep-link to the artifact to their victim. The victim opens the link the script starts running. As the script has access to the Argo Server API (as the victim) so may read information about the victim’s workflows or create and delete workflows. Note the attacker must be an insider: they must have access to the same cluster as the victim and must already be able to run their own workflows. The attacker must have an understanding of the victim’s system. We have seen no evidence of this in the wild. We urge all users to upgrade to the fixed versions.,7.1,CWE-269

CVE-2025-30144,fast-jwt provides fast JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation. Prior to 5.0.6 the fast-jwt library does not properly validate the iss claim based on the RFC 7519. The iss (issuer) claim validation within the fast-jwt library permits an array of strings as a valid iss value. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a JWT with an iss claim structured as ['https://attacker-domain/' 'https://valid-iss']. Due to the permissive validation the JWT will be deemed valid. Furthermore if the application relies on external libraries like get-jwks that do not independently validate the iss claim the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to forge a JWT that will be accepted by the victim application. Essentially the attacker can insert their own domain into the iss array alongside the legitimate issuer and bypass the intended security checks. This issue is fixed in 5.0.6.,6.5,CWE-290

CVE-2025-49131,FastGPT is an open-source project that provides a platform for building deploying and operating AI-driven workflows and conversational agents. The Sandbox container (fastgpt-sandbox) is a specialized isolated environment used by FastGPT to safely execute user-submitted or dynamically generated code in isolation. The sandbox before version 4.9.11 has insufficient isolation and inadequate restrictions on code execution by allowing overly permissive syscalls which allows attackers to escape the intended sandbox boundaries. Attackers could exploit this to read and overwrite arbitrary files and bypass Python module import restrictions. This is patched in version 4.9.11 by restricting the allowed system calls to a safer subset and additional descriptive error messaging.,6.3,CWE-732

CVE-2023-22404,An Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol daemon (iked) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX series and MX with SPC3 allows an authenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). iked will crash and restart and the tunnel will not come up when a peer sends a specifically formatted payload during the negotiation. This will impact other IKE negotiations happening at the same time. Continued receipt of this specifically formatted payload will lead to continuous crashing of iked and thereby the inability for any IKE negotiations to take place. Note that this payload is only processed after the authentication has successfully completed. So the issue can only be exploited by an attacker who can successfully authenticate. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and MX Series with SPC3: All versions prior to 19.3R3-S7; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S1 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R1-S2 22.1R2.,6.5,CWE-787

CVE-2023-52627,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events  AD7091R-5 devices are supported by the ad7091r-5 driver together with the ad7091r-base driver. Those drivers declared iio events for notifying user space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limit registers or above the values set in high limit registers. However to configure iio events and their thresholds a set of callback functions must be implemented and those were not present until now. The consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without the proper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernel because the pointers to the callback functions were not set.  Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/write event thresholds and enable/disable event generation.  Since the event spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices also move those from the ad7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reused when support for ad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.,5.5,CWE-476
