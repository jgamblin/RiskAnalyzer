CVE-2022-26477,The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable which if tampered with may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix we added an upper bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We classify it as a low-priority but useful improvement. SystemDS is a distributed system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in many code paths (e.g. on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence files) the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints. In this particular case though the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number of columns which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in a consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly improved with almost zero overhead. These code changes are available in versions higher than 2.2.1.,7.5,CWE-400
CVE-2025-66448,vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). Prior to 0.11.1 vllm has a critical remote code execution vector in a config class named Nemotron_Nano_VL_Config. When vllm loads a model config that contains an auto_map entry the config class resolves that mapping with get_class_from_dynamic_module(...) and immediately instantiates the returned class. This fetches and executes Python from the remote repository referenced in the auto_map string. Crucially this happens even when the caller explicitly sets trust_remote_code=False in vllm.transformers_utils.config.get_config. In practice an attacker can publish a benign-looking frontend repo whose config.json points via auto_map to a separate malicious backend repo; loading the frontend will silently run the backend’s code on the victim host. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.11.1.,7.1,CWE-94
CVE-2024-29200,Kimai is a web-based multi-user time-tracking application.

CVE-2023-27592,Miniflux is a feed reader. Since v2.0.25 Miniflux will automatically proxy images served over HTTP to prevent mixed content errors.   When an outbound request made by the Go HTTP client fails the `html.ServerError` is returned unescaped without the expected Content Security Policy header added to valid responses.  By creating an RSS feed item with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag with a `srcset` attribute pointing to an invalid URL like `http:a<script>alert(1)</script>` we can coerce the proxy handler into an error condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full.  This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the user is convinced (e.g. by a message in the alt text) to open the broken image.  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim Miniflux user when they open a broken image in a crafted RSS feed. This can be used to perform actions on the Miniflux instance as that user and gain administrative access to the Miniflux instance if it is reachable and the victim is an administrator.

CVE-2023-52779,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC flag to getattr interface function  When vfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem's getattr interface function then the 'nosec' should propagate into this function so that vfs_getattr_nosec() can again be called from the filesystem's gettattr rather than vfs_getattr(). The latter would add unnecessary security checks that the initial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to avoid. Therefore introduce the getattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to pass with the new getattr_flags parameter to the getattr interface function. In overlayfs and ecryptfs use this flag to determine which one of the two functions to call.  In a recent code change introduced to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended up calling vfs_getattr() in overlayfs which in turn called security_inode_getattr() on an exiting process that did not have current->fs set anymore which then caused a kernel NULL pointer dereference. With this change the call to security_inode_getattr() can be avoided thus avoiding the NULL pointer dereference.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-37271,RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python language which allows users to provide a program input into a trusted environment. RestrictedPython does not check access to stack frames and their attributes. Stack frames are accessible within at least generators and generator expressions which are allowed inside RestrictedPython. Prior to versions 6.1 and 5.3 an attacker with access to a RestrictedPython environment can write code that gets the current stack frame in a generator and then walk the stack all the way beyond the RestrictedPython invocation boundary thus breaking out of the restricted sandbox and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution in the Python interpreter. All RestrictedPython deployments that allow untrusted users to write Python code in the RestrictedPython environment are at risk. In terms of Zope and Plone this would mean deployments where the administrator allows untrusted users to create and/or edit objects of type `Script (Python)` `DTML Method` `DTML Document` or `Zope Page Template`. This is a non-default configuration and likely to be extremely rare. The problem has been fixed in versions 6.1 and 5.3.,8.4,CWE-913

CVE-2025-27587,OpenSSL 3.0.0 through 3.3.2 on the PowerPC architecture is vulnerable to a Minerva attack exploitable by measuring the time of signing of random messages using the EVP_DigestSign API and then using the private key to extract the K value (nonce) from the signatures. Next based on the bit size of the extracted nonce one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.,5.3,CWE-385

CVE-2023-1314,A vulnerability has been discovered in cloudflared's installer (<= 2023.3.0) for Windows 32-bits devices that allows a local attacker with no administrative permissions to escalate their privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability exists because the MSI installer used by cloudflared relied on a world-writable directory.  An attacker with local access to the device (without Administrator rights) can use symbolic links to trick the MSI installer into deleting files in locations that the attacker would otherwise have no access to. By creating a symlink from the world-writable directory to the target file the attacker can manipulate the MSI installer's repair functionality to delete the target file during the repair process.  Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to delete important system files or replace them with malicious files potentially leading to the affected device being compromised.  The cloudflared client itself is not affected by this vulnerability only the installer for 32-bit Windows devices.  ,7.5,CWE-59
