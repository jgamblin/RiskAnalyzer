CVE-2023-40033,Flarum is an open source forum software. Flarum is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker to conduct a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack or disclose any file on the server even with a basic user account on any Flarum forum. By uploading a file containing a URL and spoofing the MIME type an attacker can manipulate the application to execute unintended actions. The vulnerability is due to the behavior of the `intervention/image` package which attempts to interpret the supplied file contents as a URL which then fetches its contents. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks disclose local file contents or conduct a blind oracle attack. This has been patched in Flarum version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable PHP's `allow_url_fopen` which will prevent the fetching of external files via URLs as a temporary workaround for the SSRF aspect of the vulnerability.,7.1,CWE-918

CVE-2024-40647,sentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentry's Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Python's `subprocess` calls all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default) this expectation is not fulfilled and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However if it's not possible and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you you can disable all default integrations. ,5.3,CWE-200

CVE-2024-58084,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: qcom: scm: Fix missing read barrier in qcom_scm_get_tzmem_pool()  Commit 2e4955167ec5 (firmware: qcom: scm: Fix __scm and waitq completion variable initialization) introduced a write barrier in probe function to store global '__scm' variable.  We all known barriers are paired (see memory-barriers.txt: Note that write barriers should normally be paired with read or address-dependency barriers) therefore accessing it from concurrent contexts requires read barrier.  Previous commit added such barrier in qcom_scm_is_available() so let's use that directly.  Lack of this read barrier can result in fetching stale '__scm' variable value NULL and dereferencing it.  Note that barrier in qcom_scm_is_available() satisfies here the control dependency.,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2023-49783,Silverstripe Admin provides a basic management interface for the Silverstripe Framework. In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19 and on the 2.x branch prior to 2.1.8 users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form provided they have create permissions. The likelihood of a user having create permissions but not having edit or delete permissions is low but it is possible. Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch for the issue. Those who have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should update their implementations to respect permissions when the return value of `getCheckPermissions()` is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in their own project logic or maintain a module which uses it should consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()` if the data is provided by users.,4.3,CWE-863

CVE-2024-45039,gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Versions prior to 0.11.0 have a soundness issue - in case of multiple commitments used inside the circuit the prover is able to choose all but the last commitment. As gnark uses the commitments for optimized non-native multiplication lookup checks etc. as random challenges then it could impact the soundness of the whole circuit. However using multiple commitments has been discouraged due to the additional cost to the verifier and it has not been supported in the recursive in-circuit Groth16 verifier and Solidity verifier. gnark's maintainers expect the impact of the issue be very small - only for the users who have implemented the native Groth16 verifier or are using it with multiple commitments. We do not have information of such users. The issue has been patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround users should follow gnark maintainers' recommendation to use only a single commitment and then derive in-circuit commitments as needed using the `std/multicommit` package.,6.2,CWE-200
