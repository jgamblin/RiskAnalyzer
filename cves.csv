CVE-2024-36912,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Drivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl  In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared) memory to the page allocator which could lead to functional or security issues.  In order to make sure callers of vmbus_establish_gpadl() and vmbus_teardown_gpadl() don't return decrypted/shared pages to allocators add a field in struct vmbus_gpadl to keep track of the decryption status of the buffers. This will allow the callers to know if they should free or leak the pages.,8.1,CWE-1258

CVE-2023-34100,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. When reading the TCP MSS option value from an incoming packet the Contiki-NG OS does not verify that certain buffer indices to read from are within the bounds of the IPv6 packet buffer uip_buf. In particular there is a 2-byte buffer read in the module os/net/ipv6/uip6.c. The buffer is indexed using 'UIP_IPTCPH_LEN + 2 + c' and 'UIP_IPTCPH_LEN + 3 + c' but the uip_buf buffer may not have enough data resulting in a 2-byte read out of bounds. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in release 4.9. Users are advised to watch for the 4.9 release and to upgrade when it becomes available. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability aside from manually patching with the diff in commit `cde4e9839`.,7.3,CWE-125

CVE-2024-45599,Cursor is an artificial intelligence code editor. Prior to version 0.41.0 if a user on macOS has granted Cursor access to the camera or microphone any program that is run on the machine is able to access the camera or the microphone without explicitly being granted access through a DyLib Injection using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable. The usage of `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` allows an external dynamic library to be injected into the application using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable.  Moreover the entitlement `com.apple.security.device.camera` allows the application to use the host camera and `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` allows the application to use the microphone. This means that untrusted code that is executed on the user's machine can access the camera or the microphone if the user has already given permission for Cursor to do so. In version 0.41.0 the entitlements have been split by process: the main process gets the camera and microphone entitlements but not the DyLib entitlements whereas the extension host process gets the DyLib entitlements but not the camera or microphone entitlements. As a workaround do not explicitly give Cursor the permission to access the camera or microphone if untrusted users can run arbitrary commands on the affected machine.,3.8,CWE-277

CVE-2024-47812,ImportDump is an extension for mediawiki designed to automate user import requests. Anyone who can edit the interface strings of a wiki (typically administrators and interface admins) can embed XSS payloads in the messages for dates and thus XSS anyone who views Special:RequestImportQueue. This issue has been patched in commit `d054b95` and all users are advised to apply this commit to their branch. Users unable to upgrade may either Prevent access to Special:RequestImportQueue on all wikis except for the global wiki; and If an interface administrator (or equivalent) level protection is available (which is not provided by default) on the global wiki protect the affected messages up to that level. This causes the XSS to be virtually useless as users with those rights can already edit Javascript pages. Or Prevent access to Special:RequestImportQueue altogether.,6.0,CWE-79

CVE-2025-25202,Ash Authentication is an authentication framework for Elixir applications. Applications which have been bootstrapped by the igniter installer present since AshAuthentication v4.1.0 and who have used the magic link strategy _or_ are manually revoking tokens are affected by revoked tokens being allowed to verify as valid. Unless one hase implemented any kind of custom token revocation feature in your application then one will not be affected. The impact here for users using builtin functionality is that magic link tokens are reusable until they expire. With that said magic link tokens are only valid for 10 minutes so the surface area for abuse is extremely low here. The flaw is patched in version 4.4.9. Additionally a compile time warning is shown to users with remediation instructions if they upgrade. 4.4.9 ships with an upgrader so those who use `mix igniter.upgrade ash_authentication` will have the necessary patch applied. Otherwise one may run the upgrader manually as described in the error message. As a workaround delete the generated `:revoked?` generic action in the token resource. This will cause it to use the one internal to Ash Authentication which has always been correct. Alternatively manually make the changes that are included in the patch.,6.5,CWE-269

CVE-2024-50041,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: Fix macvlan leak by synchronizing access to mac_filter_hash  This patch addresses a macvlan leak issue in the i40e driver caused by concurrent access to vsi->mac_filter_hash. The leak occurs when multiple threads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously leading to inconsistent state and potential memory leaks.  To fix this we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing vf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.  Additionally we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) in i40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them. 2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g. adding and deleting 	portvlan and/or mac filters). 3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the 	mac_filter_hash.  This synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents the described leak.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2023-45821,Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding installing and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects. During a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base a security researcher identified a bug in which the `registryIsDockerHub` function was only checking that the registry domain had the `docker.io` suffix. Artifact Hub allows providing some Docker credentials that are used to increase the rate limit applied when interacting with the Docker Hub registry API to read publicly available content. Due to the incorrect check described above it'd be possible to hijack those credentials by purchasing a domain which ends with `docker.io` and deploying a fake OCI registry on it. <https://artifacthub.io/> uses some credentials that only have permissions to read public content available in the Docker Hub. However even though credentials for private repositories (disabled on `artifacthub.io`) are handled in a different way other Artifact Hub deployments could have been using them for a different purpose.

CVE-2024-48982,An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3 but the software doesn't ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a buffer overflow in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another integer overflow by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.,7.5,CWE-120

CVE-2023-52503,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tee: amdtee: fix use-after-free vulnerability in amdtee_close_session  There is a potential race condition in amdtee_close_session that may cause use-after-free in amdtee_open_session. For instance if a session has refcount == 1 and one thread tries to free this session via:      kref_put(&sess->refcount destroy_session);  the reference count will get decremented and the next step would be to call destroy_session(). However if in another thread amdtee_open_session() is called before destroy_session() has completed execution alloc_session() may return 'sess' that will be freed up later in destroy_session() leading to use-after-free in amdtee_open_session.  To fix this issue treat decrement of sess->refcount and removal of 'sess' from session list in destroy_session() as a critical section so that it is executed atomically.,7.0,CWE-416
