CVE-2023-40273,The session fixation vulnerability allowed the authenticated user to continue accessing Airflow webserver even after the password of the user has been reset by the admin - up until the expiry of the session of the user. Other than manually cleaning the session database (for database session backend) or changing the secure_key and restarting the webserver there were no mechanisms to force-logout the user (and all other users with that).  With this fix implemented when using the database session backend the existing sessions of the user are invalidated when the password of the user is reset. When using the securecookie session backend the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver (and logging out all other users) but the user resetting the password is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI. Documentation is also updated explaining this behaviour.  Users of Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability. ,8.0,CWE-384

CVE-2025-21751,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: HWS change error flow on matcher disconnect  Currently when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns an error which continues running the calling function and eventually frees the matcher that is being disconnected. This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.  This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when some FW command fails during disconnect.  Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this problem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection between matchers) and will also lead to resource leakage as it is the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.  However the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash the machine with use-after-free error.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-46232,era-compiler-vyper is the EraVM Vyper compiler for zkSync Era a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum. Prior to era-compiler-vype version 1.3.10 a bug prevented the initialization of the first immutable variable for Vyper contracts meeting certain criteria. The problem arises when there is a String or Array with more 256-bit words allocated than initialized. It results in the second word’s index unset that is effectively set to 0 so the first immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the ImmutableSimulator. Version 1.3.10 fixes this issue by setting all indexes in advance. The problem will go away but it will get more expensive if the user allocates a lot of uninitialized space e.g. `String[4096]`. Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way of working around the issue. ,5.3,CWE-471

CVE-2024-56140,Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. In affected versions a bug in Astro’s CSRF-protection middleware allows requests to bypass CSRF checks. When the `security.checkOrigin` configuration option is set to `true` Astro middleware will perform a CSRF check. However a vulnerability exists that can bypass this security.

CVE-2025-21638,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: sysctl: auth_enable: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only   from the opener's netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases resulting in an 'Oops'   (null-ptr-deref) e.g. when the current task is exiting as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using container_of().  Note that table->data could also be used directly but that would increase the size of this fix while 'sctp.ctl_sock' still needs to be retrieved from 'net' structure.,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2025-0723,The ProfileGrid – User Profiles Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind and time-based SQL Injections via the rid and search parameters in all versions up to and including 5.9.4.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

This is due to the plugin not providing sufficient path validation on the tree_node[node][id] parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with admin-level access and above to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files retrieve sensitive data or execute code.,7.2,CWE-502
CVE-2024-56695,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'  The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable which could lead to stack overflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc` thereby reducing the stack size.  This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space  in scenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is freed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory leaks.  Fixes the below with gcc W=1: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function ‘kfd_get_cu_occupancy’: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]   322 | }       | ^,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2024-11549,IrfanView DXF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data which can result in a write  past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24746.,7.8,CWE-787
CVE-2024-26704,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix double-free of blocks due to wrong extents moved_len  In ext4_move_extents() moved_len is only updated when all moves are successfully executed and only discards orig_inode and donor_inode preallocations when moved_len is not zero. When the loop fails to exit after successfully moving some extents moved_len is not updated and remains at 0 so it does not discard the preallocations.  If the moved extents overlap with the preallocated extents the overlapped extents are freed twice in ext4_mb_release_inode_pa() and ext4_process_freed_data() (as described in commit 94d7c16cbbbd (ext4: Fix double-free of blocks with EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT)) and bb_free is incremented twice. Hence when trim is executed a zero-division bug is triggered in mb_update_avg_fragment_size() because bb_free is not zero and bb_fragments is zero.  Therefore update move_len after each extent move to avoid the issue.,7.8,CWE-415
