CVE-2023-20035,A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the system CLI. An attacker with privileges to run commands could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to an affected device using either local terminal access or a management shell interface and then submitting crafted input to the system CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges. An attacker with limited user privileges could use this vulnerability to gain complete control over the system.

CVE-2025-47950,CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. In versions prior to 1.12.2 a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams` which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size` which Introduces a server-wide bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in the Corefile use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2023-41890,Sustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support to ASP.NET web sites allowing the web site to act as a SAML2 Service Provider.  Prior to versions 1.0.3 and 2.9.2 when a response is processed the issuer of the Identity Provider is not sufficiently validated. This could allow a malicious identity provider to craft a Saml2 response that is processed as if issued by another identity provider. It is also possible for a malicious end user to cause stored state intended for one identity provider to be used when processing the response from another provider. An application is impacted if they rely on any of these features in their authentication/authorization logic: the issuer of the generated identity and claims; or items in the stored request state (AuthenticationProperties). This issue is patched in versions 2.9.2 and 1.0.3. The `AcsCommandResultCreated` notification can be used to add the validation required if an upgrade to patched packages is not possible.,7.5,CWE-289

CVE-2024-34698,FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions of FreeScout prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters Parsing) without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key `__proto__` along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself. As a result the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in an unsafe way this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS Open Redirection Cookie Manipulation Link Manipulation HTML Injection etc. Version 1.8.139 contains a patch for the issue.,4.6,CWE-1321

CVE-2025-53097,Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to version 3.20.3 there was an issue where the Roo Code agent's `search_files` tool did not respect the setting to disable reads outside of the VS Code workspace. This means that an attacker who was able to inject a prompt into the agent could potentially read a sensitive file and then write the information to a JSON schema. Users have the option to disable schema fetching in VS Code but the feature is enabled by default. For users with this feature enabled writing to the schema would trigger a network request without the user having a chance to deny. This issue is of moderate severity since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent. Version 3.20.3 fixed the issue where `search_files` did not respect the setting to limit it to the workspace. This reduces the scope of the damage if an attacker is able to take control of the agent through prompt injection or another vector.,5.9,CWE-74

CVE-2024-46850,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn35_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()  dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe context passed to dcn35_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.  If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which calls dcn35_set_drr() at some point) we can end up using already nulled function callback fields of struct stream_resource.  The logic in dcn35_set_drr() already tries to avoid this by checking tg against NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and before the next access then we get a race.  Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable and then use this variable for all the operations. This should work as long as nobody frees the resource pool where the timing generators live.

CVE-2022-29965,The Emerson DeltaV Distributed Control System (DCS) controllers and IO cards through 2022-04-29 misuse passwords. Access to privileged operations on the maintenance port TELNET interface (23/TCP) on M-series and SIS (CSLS/LSNB/LSNG) nodes is controlled by means of utility passwords. These passwords are generated using a deterministic insecure algorithm using a single seed value composed of a day/hour/minute timestamp with less than 16 bits of entropy. The seed value is fed through a lookup table and a series of permutation operations resulting in three different four-character passwords corresponding to different privilege levels.

CVE-2025-32421,Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Versions prior to 14.2.24 and 15.1.6 have a race-condition vulnerability. This issue only affects the Pages Router under certain misconfigurations causing normal endpoints to serve `pageProps` data instead of standard HTML. This issue was patched in versions 15.1.6 and 14.2.24 by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from incoming requests. Applications hosted on Vercel's platform are not affected by this issue as the platform does not cache responses based solely on `200 OK` status without explicit `cache-control` headers. Those who self-host Next.js deployments and are unable to upgrade immediately can mitigate this vulnerability by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from all incoming requests at the content development network and setting `cache-control: no-store` for all responses under risk. The maintainers of Next.js strongly recommend only caching responses with explicit cache-control headers.,3.7,CWE-362

CVE-2023-34322,For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (see XSA-273) PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode.  Since Xen itself needs to be mapped when PV guests run Xen and shadowed PV guests run directly the respective shadow page tables.  For 64-bit PV guests this means running on the shadow of the guest root page table.  In the course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool associated with a domain shadows of page tables may be torn down.  This tearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU in question is presently running on.  While a precaution exists to supposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table the time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough. ,7.8,CWE-273
