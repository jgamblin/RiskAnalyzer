CVE-2022-48862,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost: fix hung thread due to erroneous iotlb entries  In vhost_iotlb_add_range_ctx() range size can overflow to 0 when start is 0 and last is ULONG_MAX. One instance where it can happen is when userspace sends an IOTLB message with iova=size=uaddr=0 (vhost_process_iotlb_msg). So an entry with size = 0 start = 0 last = ULONG_MAX ends up in the iotlb. Next time a packet is sent iotlb_access_ok() loops indefinitely due to that erroneous entry.  	Call Trace: 	 <TASK> 	 iotlb_access_ok+0x21b/0x3e0 drivers/vhost/vhost.c:1340 	 vq_meta_prefetch+0xbc/0x280 drivers/vhost/vhost.c:1366 	 vhost_transport_do_send_pkt+0xe0/0xfd0 drivers/vhost/vsock.c:104 	 vhost_worker+0x23d/0x3d0 drivers/vhost/vhost.c:372 	 kthread+0x2e9/0x3a0 kernel/kthread.c:377 	 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:295 	 </TASK>  Reported by syzbot at: 	https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=0abd373e2e50d704db87  To fix this do two things:  1.

CVE-2024-53862,Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. When using `--auth-mode=client` Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a fake or spoofed token via the GET Workflow endpoint: `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` or when using `--auth-mode=sso` all Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a valid token via the GET Workflow endpoint: `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}`. No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8 the auth check was accidentally removed on the GET Workflow endpoint's fallback to archived workflows on these lines allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2 and 3.5.13.,7.5,CWE-200

CVE-2024-45306,Vim is an open source command line text editor. Patch v9.1.0038 optimized how the cursor position is calculated and removed a loop that verified that the cursor position always points inside a line and does not become invalid by pointing beyond the end of a line.

CVE-2023-27600,OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\n`).  The vulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed (`\n`).  By abusing this vulnerability an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function exploitation of this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue is patched in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.,7.5,CWE-20

CVE-2024-53179,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key  Customers have reported use-after-free in @ses->auth_key.response with SMB2.1 + sign mounts which occurs due to following race:  task A                         task B cifs_mount()  dfs_mount_share()   get_session()    cifs_mount_get_session()    cifs_send_recv()     cifs_get_smb_ses()          compound_send_recv()      cifs_setup_session()        smb2_setup_request()       kfree_sensitive()           smb2_calc_signature()                                    crypto_shash_setkey() *UAF*  Fix this by ensuring that we have a valid @ses->auth_key.response by checking whether @ses->ses_status is SES_GOOD or SES_EXITING with @ses->ses_lock held.  After commit 24a9799aa8ef (smb: client: fix UAF in smb2_reconnect_server()) we made sure to call ->logoff() only when @ses was known to be good (e.g. valid ->auth_key.response) so it's safe to access signing key when @ses->ses_status == SES_EXITING.,7.8,CWE-416
