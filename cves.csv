CVE-2024-45389,Pagefind a fully static search library initializes its dynamic JavaScript and WebAssembly files relative to the location of the first script the user loads. This information is gathered by looking up the value of `document.currentScript.src`. Prior to Pagefind version 1.1.1 it is possible to clobber this lookup with otherwise benign HTML on the page. This will cause `document.currentScript.src` to resolve as an external domain which will then be used by Pagefind to load dependencies. This exploit would only work in the case that an attacker could inject HTML to a live hosted website. In these cases this would act as a way to escalate the privilege available to an attacker. This assumes they have the ability to add some elements to the page (for example `img` tags with a `name` attribute) but not others as adding a `script` to the page would itself be the cross-site scripting vector. Pagefind has tightened this resolution in version 1.1.1 by ensuring the source is loaded from a valid script element. There are no reports of this being exploited in the wild via Pagefind.,6.4,CWE-79
CVE-2024-26111,Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.20 and earlier are affected by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.3 (Confidentiality Integrity and Availability impacts).  CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).,7.3,CWE-284
CVE-2024-47164,Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the `is_in_or_equal` function. This function intended to check if a file resides within a given directory can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they are able to exploit this flaw although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying on Gradio’s blocklist or directory access validation particularly when handling file uploads. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue. As a workaround users can manually sanitize and normalize file paths in their Gradio deployment before passing them to the `is_in_or_equal` function. Ensuring that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute can help mitigate the bypass vulnerabilities caused by the improper handling of `..` sequences or malformed paths.,6.5,CWE-22

CVE-2024-28255,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.,9.8,CWE-287

CVE-2024-41111,Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework it can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. Sliver version 1.6.0 (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged operator user. The RCE is as the system root user. The exploit is pretty fun as we make the Sliver server pwn itself. As described in a past issue (#65) there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server. An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console logs kick all other operators view and modify files stored on the server and ultimately delete the server. This issue has not yet be addressed but is expected to be resolved before the full release of version 1.6.0. Users of the 1.6.0 prerelease should avoid using Silver in production.,7.2,CWE-74

CVE-2025-38440,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: Fix race between DIM disable and net_dim()  There's a race between disabling DIM and NAPI callbacks using the dim pointer on the RQ or SQ.  If NAPI checks the DIM state bit and sees it still set it assumes `rq->dim` or `sq->dim` is valid. But if DIM gets disabled right after that check the pointer might already be set to NULL leading to a NULL pointer dereference in net_dim().  Fix this by calling `synchronize_net()` before freeing the DIM context. This ensures all in-progress NAPI callbacks are finished before the pointer is cleared.

CVE-2024-37904,Minder is an open source Software Supply Chain Security Platform. Minder's Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First it sets the `CloneOptions` specifying the url the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem to which it clones and Finally it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack: A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions: 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones 2. Minder does not enforce a size limit to the repository 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.7,CWE-400

CVE-2025-57800,Audiobookshelf is an open-source self-hosted audiobook server. In versions 2.6.0 through 2.26.3 the application does not properly restrict redirect callback URLs during OIDC authentication. An attacker can craft a login link that causes Audiobookshelf to store an arbitrary callback in a cookie which is later used to redirect the user after authentication. The server then issues a 302 redirect to the attacker-controlled URL appending sensitive OIDC tokens as query parameters. This allows an attacker to obtain the victim's tokens and perform full account takeover including creating persistent admin users if the victim is an administrator. Tokens are further leaked via browser history Referer headers and server logs. This vulnerability impacts all Audiobookshelf deployments using OIDC; no IdP misconfiguration is required. The issue is fixed in version 2.28.0. No known workarounds exist.,8.8,CWE-523
