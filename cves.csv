CVE-2024-53192,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: clk-loongson2: Fix potential buffer overflow in flexible-array member access  Flexible-array member `hws` in `struct clk_hw_onecell_data` is annotated with the `counted_by()` attribute. This means that when memory is allocated for this array the _counter_ which in this case is member `num` in the flexible structure should be set to the maximum number of elements the flexible array can contain or fewer.  In this case the total number of elements for the flexible array is determined by variable `clks_num` when allocating heap space via `devm_kzalloc()` as shown below:  289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp; 	... 296         for (p = data; p->name; p++) 297                 clks_num++; 298 299         clp = devm_kzalloc(dev struct_size(clp clk_data.hws clks_num) 300                            GFP_KERNEL);  So `clp->clk_data.num` should be set to `clks_num` or less and not exceed `clks_num` as is currently the case. Otherwise if data is written into `clp->clk_data.hws[clks_num]` the instrumentation provided by the compiler won't detect the overflow leading to a memory corruption bug at runtime.  Fix this issue by setting `clp->clk_data.num` to `clks_num`.,5.5,CWE-120

CVE-2023-0466,The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.  As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function.  Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.  Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.,5.3,CWE-295

CVE-2024-22423,yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The patch that addressed CVE-2023-40581 attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes. However this escaping is not sufficient and still allows expansion of environment variables. Support for output template expansion in `--exec` along with this vulnerable behavior was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. It replaces them with `%%cd:~%` a variable that expands to nothing leaving only the leading percent. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also always be careful when using `--exec` because while this specific vulnerability has been patched using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath); if expansion in `--exec` is needed verify the fields you are using do not contain `` `|` or `&`; and/or instead of using `--exec` write the info json and load the fields from it instead.,8.3,CWE-78

CVE-2025-23028,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. A denial of service vulnerability affects versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7 1.15.0 through 1.15.11 and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4. In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS traffic an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads from outside the cluster. For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads that have DNS-based policy configured existing connections may continue to operate and new connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established but new connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to restart. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18 v1.15.12 and v1.16.5. No known workarounds are available.,5.3,CWE-770

CVE-2023-27598,OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 sending a malformed `Via` header to OpenSIPS triggers a segmentation fault when the function `calc_tag_suffix` is called.
