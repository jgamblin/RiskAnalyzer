CVE-2024-56759,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled  When a COWing a tree block at btrfs_cow_block() and we have the tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y) we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent buffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths that call btrfs_cow_block() such as btrfs_search_slot() we are holding the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block() drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls free_extent_buffer_stale(buf) which schedules the release of the extent buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block() and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block() is called resulting in a use-after-free.  Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed. This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag code at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node() since btrfs_force_cow_block() is called there but this is fine and it was actually missing there.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-48822,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: f_fs: Fix use-after-free for epfile  Consider a case where ffs_func_eps_disable is called from ffs_func_disable as part of composition switch and at the same time ffs_epfile_release get called from userspace. ffs_epfile_release will free up the read buffer and call ffs_data_closed which in turn destroys ffs->epfiles and mark it as NULL. While this was happening the driver has already initialized the local epfile in ffs_func_eps_disable which is now freed and waiting to acquire the spinlock. Once spinlock is acquired the driver proceeds with the stale value of epfile and tries to free the already freed read buffer causing use-after-free.  Following is the illustration of the race:        CPU1                                  CPU2     ffs_func_eps_disable    epfiles (local copy) 					ffs_epfile_release 					ffs_data_closed 					if (last file closed) 					ffs_data_reset 					ffs_data_clear 					ffs_epfiles_destroy spin_lock dereference epfiles  Fix this races by taking epfiles local copy & assigning it under spinlock and if epfiles(local) is null then update it in ffs->epfiles then finally destroy it.

CVE-2024-52581,Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to version 2.13.0 the multipart form parser shipped with litestar expects the entire request body as a single byte string and there is no default limit for the total size of the request body.

CVE-2020-26312,Dotmesh is a git-like command-line interface for capturing organizing and sharing application states. In versions 0.8.1 and prior the unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may  enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the  designated target folder. The routine `untarFile` attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent` to `..` (allowed because `subdir/..` falls within the archive root) and then linking `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s parent directory contrary to the routine’s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication no patch for this issue is available. ,8.1,CWE-125

CVE-2022-40735,The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that (appropriately) short exponents can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g. TLS SSH or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations.
