CVE-2024-40913,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachefiles: defer exposing anon_fd until after copy_to_user() succeeds  After installing the anonymous fd we can now see it in userland and close it. However at this point we may not have gotten the reference count of the cache but we will put it during colse fd so this may cause a cache UAF.  So grab the cache reference count before fd_install(). In addition by kernel convention fd is taken over by the user land after fd_install() and the kernel should not call close_fd() after that i.e. it should call fd_install() after everything is ready thus fd_install() is called after copy_to_user() succeeds.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-46689,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC not WB  Linux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is write protected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache eviction as write into the write protected region leading to secure interrupt which causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.  The only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisor maps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translation tables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like Xen or KVM) which does not know anything about those specific mappings.  Changing the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC removes dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patch fixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.  I tested this on SA8155P with Xen.,5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2023-44398,Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read write delete and modify Exif IPTC XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds write was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable function `BmffImage::brotliUncompress` is new in v0.28.0 so earlier versions of Exiv2 are _not_ affected.
