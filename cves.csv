CVE-2023-49284,fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS Linux and the rest of the family. fish shell uses certain Unicode non-characters internally for marking wildcards and expansions. It will incorrectly allow these markers to be read on command substitution output rather than transforming them into a safe internal representation. While this may cause unexpected behavior with direct input (for example echo \UFDD2HOME has the same output as echo $HOME) this may become a minor security problem if the output is being fed from an external program into a command substitution where this output may not be expected. This design flaw was introduced in very early versions of fish predating the version control system and is thought to be present in every version of fish released in the last 15 years or more although with different characters. Code execution does not appear to be possible but denial of service (through large brace expansion) or information disclosure (such as variable expansion) is potentially possible under certain circumstances. fish shell 3.6.2 has been released to correct this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,3.9,CWE-436

CVE-2023-25577,Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version 2.2.3 Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data` `request.form` `request.files` or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)` it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process.

CVE-2024-13176,Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.  Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak the attacker process must either be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low.  The FIPS modules in 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.,4.1,CWE-385

CVE-2022-42332,x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where host assisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) is unavailable Xen will run guests in so called shadow mode. Shadow mode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page tables as well as auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests Xen additionally runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-28847,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. Similarly to the GHSL-2023-250 issue `AlertUtil::validateExpression` is also called from `EventSubscriptionRepository.prepare()` which can lead to Remote Code Execution. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which in turn gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`) it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and therefore after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method an attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/events/subscriptions` which gets handled by `EventSubscriptionResource.createOrUpdateEventSubscription()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-251`.,8.8,CWE-94
