CVE-2023-35344,Windows DNS Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,6.6,CWE-591
CVE-2022-20943,Multiple vulnerabilities in the Server Message Block Version 2 (SMB2) processor of the Snort detection engine on multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass the configured policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.    These vulnerabilities are due to improper management of system resources when the Snort detection engine is processing SMB2 traffic. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a high rate of certain types of SMB2 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the Snort process resulting in a DoS condition.    Note: When the snort preserve-connection option is enabled for the Snort detection engine a successful exploit could also allow the attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network. The snort preserve-connection setting is enabled by default. See the Details [#details] section of this advisory for more information.    Note: Only products that have Snort 3 configured are affected. Products that are configured with Snort 2 are not affected.,5.8,CWE-244
