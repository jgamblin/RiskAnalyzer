CVE-2024-29192,gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. The `/api/config` endpoint allows one to modify the existing configuration with user-supplied values. While the API is only allowing localhost to interact without authentication an attacker may be able to achieve that depending on how go2rtc is set up on the upstream application and given that this endpoint is not protected against CSRF it allows requests from any origin (e.g. a drive-by attack) . The `exec` handler allows for any stream to execute arbitrary commands. An attacker may add a custom stream through `api/config` which may lead to arbitrary command execution. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question their browser will execute the requests against the go2rtc instance. Commit 8793c3636493c5efdda08f3b5ed5c6e1ea594fd9 adds a warning about secure API access.,8.8,CWE-352
CVE-2024-27059,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command  The isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values in the ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values when creating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands.  The calculation involves division and modulus operations which will cause a crash if either of these values is 0.  While this never happens with a genuine device it could happen with a flawed or subversive emulation as reported by the syzbot fuzzer.  Protect against this possibility by refusing to bind to the device if either the ATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's ID information is 0.  This requires isd200_Initialization() to return a negative error code when initialization fails; currently it always returns 0 (even when there is an error).,5.5,CWE-369

CVE-2024-22417,Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions 0.8.3 and prior the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes them to the `send` method which sends a `GET` request on lines 339-343 in `requests.py`. The returned contents of the URL are then passed to and reflected back to the user in the `send_file` function on line 484 together with the user-controlled `src_type` which allows the attacker to control the HTTP response content type leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker could craft a special URL to point to a malicious website and send the link to a victim. The fact that the link would contain a trusted domain (e.g. from one of public Whoogle instances) could be used to trick the user into clicking the link. The malicious website could for example be a copy of a real website meant to steal a person’s credentials to the website or trick that person in another way.
