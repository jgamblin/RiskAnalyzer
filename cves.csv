CVE-2024-28864,SecureProps is a PHP library designed to simplify the encryption and decryption of property data in objects. A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher` and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.,2.6,CWE-1333

CVE-2025-21909,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: nl80211: reject cooked mode if it is set along with other flags  It is possible to set both MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES and MONITOR_FLAG_ACTIVE flags simultaneously on the same monitor interface from the userspace. This causes a sub-interface to be created with no IEEE80211_SDATA_IN_DRIVER bit set because the monitor interface is in the cooked state and it takes precedence over all other states. When the interface is then being deleted the kernel calls WARN_ONCE() from check_sdata_in_driver() because of missing that bit.

CVE-2024-27003,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: Get runtime PM before walking tree for clk_summary  Similar to the previous commit we should make sure that all devices are runtime resumed before printing the clk_summary through debugfs. Failure to do so would result in a deadlock if the thread is resuming a device to print clk state and that device is also runtime resuming in another thread e.g the screen is turning on and the display driver is starting up. We remove the calls to clk_pm_runtime_{getput}() in this path because they're superfluous now that we know the devices are runtime resumed. This also squashes a bug where the return value of clk_pm_runtime_get() wasn't checked leading to an RPM count underflow on error paths.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-21919,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/fair: Fix potential memory corruption in child_cfs_rq_on_list  child_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert a 'prev' pointer to a cfs_rq. This 'prev' pointer can originate from struct rq's leaf_cfs_rq_list making the conversion invalid and potentially leading to memory corruption. Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and the task group (tg) pointer within the struct this can cause a memory fault or access garbage data.  The issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq where both cfs_rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same leaf list. Also rq->tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list.  This adds a check `if (prev == &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main conditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of operation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.  This check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added to the list so verifying the 'prev' pointer against the current rq's list head is enough.  Fixes a potential memory corruption issue that due to current struct layout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable behavior when the layout changes.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2024-43357,ECMA-262 is the language specification for the scripting language ECMAScript. A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators introduced by a May 2021 spec refactor may lead to mis-implementation in a way that could present as a security vulnerability such as type confusion and pointer dereference.  The internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult (`{ done value }`) objects that it creates assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype` so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able triggering arbitrary behaviour including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants.  The ECMAScript specification is a living standard and the issue has been addressed at the time of this advisory's public disclosure. JavaScript engine implementors should refer to the latest specification and update their implementations to comply with the `AsyncGenerator` section.  ## References  - https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/commit/1e24a286d0a327d08e1154926b3ee79820232727 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1901411 - https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/security/advisories/GHSA-f67q-wr6w-23jq - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275407 - https://issues.chromium.org/issues/346692561 - https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7652,8.6,CWE-248

CVE-2023-0461,There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured but the operation does not require any privilege.  There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock.  When CONFIG_TLS is enabled user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener the context is inherited and vulnerable.  The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege.  We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-24734,MyBB is a free and open source forum software. In affected versions the Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update making it possible to add settings of supported type `php` with PHP code executed on on _Change Settings_ pages. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the `Can manage settings?` permission. MyBB's Settings module which allows administrators to add edit and delete non-default settings stores setting data in an options code string ($options_code; mybb_settings.optionscode database column) that identifies the setting type and its options separated by a new line character (\n). In MyBB 1.2.0 support for setting type php was added for which the remaining part of the options code is PHP code executed on Change Settings pages (reserved for plugins and internal use). MyBB 1.8.30 resolves this issue. There are no known workarounds.,7.2,CWE-94
CVE-2025-31479,canonical/get-workflow-version-action is a GitHub composite action to get commit SHA that GitHub Actions reusable workflow was called with. Prior to 1.0.1 if the get-workflow-version-action step fails the exception output may include the GITHUB_TOKEN. If the full token is included in the exception output GitHub will automatically redact the secret from the GitHub Actions logs. However the token may be truncated—causing part of the GITHUB_TOKEN to be displayed in plaintext in the GitHub Actions logs. Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository can view GitHub Actions logs. For public repositories anyone can view the GitHub Actions logs. The opportunity to exploit this vulnerability is limited—the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically revoked when the job completes. However there is an opportunity for an attack in the time between the GITHUB_TOKEN being displayed in the logs and the completion of the job. Users using the github-token input are impacted. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1.,8.2,CWE-532
