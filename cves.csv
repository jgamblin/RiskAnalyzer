CVE-2025-0685,A flaw was found in grub2. When reading data from a jfs filesystem grub's jfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size however it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the grub_jfs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the internal buffer length during grub_jfs_read_file(). This issue can be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.,6.4,CWE-787

CVE-2024-50156,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()  If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then `block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function _does_ have code to try to handle it with:    if (*reg)     dump_addr = *reg;  ...but since dump_addr is initialized to NULL the above is actually a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.  Make the function print Registers not stored when it sees a NULL to solve this. Since we're touching the code fix msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

CVE-2022-48890,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: storvsc: Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VM  storvsc_queuecommand() maps the scatter/gather list using scsi_dma_map() which in a confidential VM allocates swiotlb bounce buffers. If the I/O submission fails in storvsc_do_io() the I/O is typically retried by higher level code but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like cause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer which is not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffer memory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problem can arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter swiotlb=force.  Fix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission error which frees the bounce buffer memory.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2025-61792,Quadient DS-700 iQ devices through 2025-09-30 might have a race condition during the quick clicking of (in order) the Question Mark button the Help Button the About button and the Help Button leading to a transition out of kiosk mode into local administrative access. NOTE: the reporter indicates that the behavior was observed sporadically during limited time on the client site making it not possible to gain more information about the specific kiosk mode crashing issue and the only conclusion was there appears to be some form of race condition. Accordingly there can be doubt that a reproducible cybersecurity vulnerability was identified; sporadic software crashes can also be caused by a hardware fault on a single device (for example transient RAM errors). The reporter also describes a variety of other issues including initial access via USB because of the absence of a lock-pick resistant locking solution for the External Controller PC cabinet which is not a cybersecurity vulnerability (section 4.1.5 of the CNA Operational Rules). Finally it is unclear whether the device or OS configuration was inappropriate given that the risks are typically limited to insider threats within the mail operations room of a large company.,6.4,CWE-362
