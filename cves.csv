CVE-2025-24787,WhoDB is an open source database management tool. In affected versions the application is vulnerable to parameter injection in database connection strings which allows an attacker to read local files on the machine the application is running on. The application uses string concatenation to build database connection URIs which are then passed to corresponding libraries responsible for setting up the database connections. This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user in many cases to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true` the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one) the attacker is able to read local files. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.6,CWE-943

CVE-2022-48988,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  memcg: fix possible use-after-free in memcg_write_event_control()  memcg_write_event_control() accesses the dentry->d_name of the specified control fd to route the write call.  As a cgroup interface file can't be renamed it's safe to access d_name as long as the specified file is a regular cgroup file.  Also as these cgroup interface files can't be removed before the directory it's safe to access the parent too.  Prior to 347c4a874710 (memcg: remove cgroup_event->cft) there was a call to __file_cft() which verified that the specified file is a regular cgroupfs file before further accesses.  The cftype pointer returned from __file_cft() was no longer necessary and the commit inadvertently dropped the file type check with it allowing any file to slip through.  With the invarients broken the d_name and parent accesses can now race against renames and removals of arbitrary files and cause use-after-free's.  Fix the bug by resurrecting the file type check in __file_cft().  Now that cgroupfs is implemented through kernfs checking the file operations needs to go through a layer of indirection.  Instead let's check the superblock and dentry type.,7.0,CWE-416

CVE-2022-24828,Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.,8.3,CWE-20

CVE-2024-52308,The GitHub CLI version 2.6.1 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution through a malicious codespace SSH server when using `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands. This has been patched in the cli v2.62.0.  Developers connect to remote codespaces through an SSH server running within the devcontainer which is generally provided through the [default devcontainer image]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-... https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration) .

This exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute arbitrary code on the user's workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand=echo hacked #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.  In `2.62.0` the remote username information is being validated before being used.,8.0,CWE-77

CVE-2024-57981,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: xhci: Fix NULL pointer dereference on certain command aborts  If a command is queued to the final usable TRB of a ring segment the enqueue pointer is advanced to the subsequent link TRB and no further. If the command is later aborted when the abort completion is handled the dequeue pointer is advanced to the first TRB of the next segment.  If no further commands are queued xhci_handle_stopped_cmd_ring() sees the ring pointers unequal and assumes that there is a pending command so it calls xhci_mod_cmd_timer() which crashes if cur_cmd was NULL.
