CVE-2024-50145,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()  build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.  __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb allocation fails keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case don't process the packets and don't push them up the network stack - they are skipped.  Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.

CVE-2024-28859,Symfony1 is a community fork of symfony 1.4 with DIC form enhancements latest Swiftmailer better performance composer compatible and PHP 8 support. Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However it is possible to include any object type in `$this->_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.0,CWE-502

CVE-2024-39461,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: bcm: rpi: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws  Commit f316cdff8d67 (clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by) annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data' with __counted_by which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in raspberrypi_discover_clocks() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has been accessed:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c:374:4   index 3 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)' (aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')  Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws which clears up the warning.,5.5,CWE-129

CVE-2024-27050,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()  When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf bpf_xdp_query_opts the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro. This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally which means that programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by libbpf writing out of bounds.  The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS) macro but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency this fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET() macro.,5.5,CWE-787

I noticed that the memset_after() here is done on a different part of the union (status) than the original cast was from (rate_driver_data) which may confuse the compiler.  Unfortunately the memset_after() trick does not work on driver_rates[] because that is part of an anonymous struct and I could not get struct_group() to do this either. Using two separate memset() calls on the two members does address the warning though.,8.2,CWE-400

CVE-2022-0028,A PAN-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware) VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target. To be misused by an external attacker the firewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a source zone that has an external facing interface. This configuration is not typical for URL filtering and if set is likely unintended by the administrator. If exploited this issue would not impact the confidentiality integrity or availability of our products. However the resulting denial-of-service (DoS) attack may help obfuscate the identity of the attacker and implicate the firewall as the source of the attack.

CVE-2024-57945,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: mm: Fix the out of bound issue of vmemmap address  In sparse vmemmap model the virtual address of vmemmap is calculated as: ((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT)). And the struct page's va can be calculated with an offset: (vmemmap + (pfn)).  However when initializing struct pages kernel actually starts from the first page from the same section that phys_ram_base belongs to. If the first page's physical address is not (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT) then we get an va below VMEMMAP_START when calculating va for it's struct page.  For example if phys_ram_base starts from 0x82000000 with pfn 0x82000 the first page in the same section is actually pfn 0x80000. During init_unavailable_range() we will initialize struct page for pfn 0x80000 with virtual address ((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - 0x2000) which is below VMEMMAP_START as well as PCI_IO_END.  This commit fixes this bug by introducing a new variable 'vmemmap_start_pfn' which is aligned with memory section size and using it to calculate vmemmap address instead of phys_ram_base.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2024-46689,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC not WB  Linux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is write protected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache eviction as write into the write protected region leading to secure interrupt which causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.  The only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisor maps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translation tables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like Xen or KVM) which does not know anything about those specific mappings.  Changing the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC removes dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patch fixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.  I tested this on SA8155P with Xen.,5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2022-3913,Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM versions 6.6.82 through 6.6.177 fail to validate the certificate of the update server when downloading updates. This failure could allow an attacker in a privileged position on the network to provide their own HTTPS endpoint or intercept communications to the legitimate endpoint. The attacker would need some pre-existing access to at least one node on the network path between the Rapid7-controlled update server and the Nexpose/InsightVM application and the ability to either spoof the update server's FQDN or redirect legitimate traffic to the attacker's server in order to exploit this vulnerability. Note that even in this scenario an attacker could not normally replace an update package with a malicious package since the update process validates a separate code-signing certificate distinct from the HTTPS certificate used for communication.
