CVE-2023-30090,Semcms Shop v4.2 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file uplaod vulnerability via the component SEMCMS_Upfile.php. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading a crafted PHP file.,9.8,CWE-434
CVE-2023-23619,Modelina is a library for generating data models based on inputs such as AsyncAPI OpenAPI or JSON Schema documents. Versions prior to 1.0.0 are vulnerable to Code injection. This issue affects anyone who is using the default presets and/or does not handle the functionality themself. This issue has been partially mitigated in version 1.0.0 with the maintainer's GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) noting It is impossible to fully guard against this because users have access to the original raw information. However as of version 1 if you only access the constrained models you will not encounter this issue. Further similar situations are NOT seen as a security issue but intended behavior. The suggested workaround from the maintainers is Fully custom presets that change the entire rendering process which can then escape the user input.,9.9,CWE-94

CVE-2024-45313,Overleaf is a web-based collaborative LaTeX editor. When installing Server Pro using the Overleaf Toolkit from before 2024-07-17 or legacy docker-compose.yml from before 2024-08-28 the configuration for LaTeX compiles was insecure by default requiring the administrator to enable the security features via a configuration setting (`SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED` in Toolkit `SANDBOXED_COMPILES` in legacy docker-compose/custom deployments). If these security features are not enabled then users have access to the `sharelatex` container resources (filesystem network environment variables) when running compiles leading to multiple file access vulnerabilities either directly or via symlinks created during compiles. The setting has now been changed to be secure by default for new installs in the Toolkit and legacy docker-compose deployment. The Overleaf Toolkit has been updated to set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` by default for new installs. It is recommended that any existing installations using the previous default setting migrate to using sibling containers. Existing installations can set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` in `config/overleaf.rc` as a mitigation. In legacy docker-compose/custom deployments `SANDBOXED_COMPILES=true` should be used.,5.4,CWE-284

CVE-2023-43123,On unix-like systems the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems.  The method File.createTempFile on unix-like systems creates a file with predefined name (so easily identifiable) and by default will create this file with the permissions -rw-r--r--. Thus if sensitive information is written to this file other local users can read this information.  File.createTempFile(String String) will create a temporary file in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir' system property is not explicitly set.   This affects the class  https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TopologySpoutLag.java#L99  and was introduced by  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3123   In practice this has a very limited impact as this class is used only if ui.disable.spout.lag.monitoring   is set to false but its value is true by default. Moreover the temporary file gets deleted soon after its creation.  The solution is to use  Files.createTempFile https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempFile(java.lang.Stringjava.lang.Stringjava.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...)  instead.  We recommend that all users upgrade to the latest version of Apache Storm.,5.5,CWE-200

CVE-2022-31075,KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1 1.10.2 and 1.9.4 EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub and that request has a very large body that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory and a body that is larger than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it through authorization only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1 1.10.2 and 1.9.4. As a workaround disable the CloudHub switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.,4.9,CWE-400

CVE-2022-39206,Onedev is an open source self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. When using Docker-based job executors the Docker socket (e.g. /var/run/docker.sock on Linux) is mounted into each Docker step. Users that can define and trigger CI/CD jobs on a project could use this to control the Docker daemon on the host machine. This is a known dangerous pattern as it can be used to break out of Docker containers and in most cases gain root privileges on the host system. This issue allows regular (non-admin) users to potentially take over the build infrastructure of a OneDev instance. Attackers need to have an account (or be able to register one) and need permission to create a project. Since code.onedev.io has the right preconditions for this to be exploited by remote attackers it could have been used to hijack builds of OneDev itself e.g. by injecting malware into the docker images that are built and pushed to Docker Hub. The impact is increased by this as described before. Users are advised to upgrade to 7.3.0 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,9.9,CWE-610

CVE-2024-35827,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()  The controllen variable is type size_t (unsigned long).  Casting it to int could lead to an integer underflow.  The check_add_overflow() function considers the type of the destination which is type int.  If we add two positive values and the result cannot fit in an integer then that's counted as an overflow.  However if we cast controllen to an int and it turns negative then negative values *can* fit into an int type so there is no overflow.  Good: 100 + (unsigned long)-4 = 96  <-- overflow  Bad: 100 + (int)-4 = 96 <-- no overflow  I deleted the cast of the sizeof() as well.  That's not a bug but the cast is unnecessary.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2024-50041,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: Fix macvlan leak by synchronizing access to mac_filter_hash  This patch addresses a macvlan leak issue in the i40e driver caused by concurrent access to vsi->mac_filter_hash. The leak occurs when multiple threads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously leading to inconsistent state and potential memory leaks.  To fix this we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing vf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.  Additionally we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) in i40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them. 2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g. adding and deleting 	portvlan and/or mac filters). 3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the 	mac_filter_hash.  This synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents the described leak.,5.5,CWE-401
