CVE-2024-42104,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries  Syzbot reported that mounting and unmounting a specific pattern of corrupted nilfs2 filesystem images causes a use-after-free of metadata file inodes which triggers a kernel bug in lru_add_fn().  As Jan Kara pointed out this is because the link count of a metadata file gets corrupted to 0 and nilfs_evict_inode() which is called from iput() tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case).  The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are read without checking.  Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.  Also thanks to Hillf Danton and Matthew Wilcox for their initial mm-layer analysis.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-49989,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/privcmd: fix error exit of privcmd_ioctl_dm_op()  The error exit of privcmd_ioctl_dm_op() is calling unlock_pages() potentially with pages being NULL leading to a NULL dereference.  Additionally lock_pages() doesn't check for pin_user_pages_fast() having been completely successful resulting in potentially not locking all pages into memory. This could result in sporadic failures when using the related memory in user mode.  Fix all of that by calling unlock_pages() always with the real number of pinned pages which will be zero in case pages being NULL and by checking the number of pages pinned by pin_user_pages_fast() matching the expected number of pages.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-41039,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp: Fix overflow checking of wmfw header  Fix the checking that firmware file buffer is large enough for the wmfw header to prevent overrunning the buffer.  The original code tested that the firmware data buffer contained enough bytes for the sums of the size of the structs  	wmfw_header + wmfw_adsp1_sizes + wmfw_footer  But wmfw_adsp1_sizes is only used on ADSP1 firmware. For ADSP2 and Halo Core the equivalent struct is wmfw_adsp2_sizes which is 4 bytes longer. So the length check didn't guarantee that there are enough bytes in the firmware buffer for a header with wmfw_adsp2_sizes.  This patch splits the length check into three separate parts. Each of the wmfw_header wmfw_adsp?_sizes and wmfw_footer are checked separately before they are used.,7.8,CWE-120

CVE-2024-56740,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs/localio: must clear res.replen in nfs_local_read_done  Otherwise memory corruption can occur due to NFSv3 LOCALIO reads leaving garbage in res.replen: - nfs3_read_done() copies that into server->read_hdrsize; from there   nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests. - nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()   which includes it in hdrsize for xdr_init_pages so that rq_rcv_buf   contains a ridiculous len. - This is copied to rq_private_buf and xs_read_stream_request()   eventually passes the kvec to sock_recvmsg() which receives incoming   data into entirely the wrong place.  This is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads when it is made to pivot back to using normal RPC.  This switch back to using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this issue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3 server while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2025-64530,Apollo Federation is an architecture for declaratively composing APIs into a unified graph. A vulnerability in versions of Apollo Federation's composition logic prior to 2.9.5 2.10.4 2.11.5 and 2.12.1 allowed some queries to Apollo Router to improperly bypass access controls on types/fields. Apollo Federation incorrectly allowed user-defined access control directives on interface types/fields which could be bypassed by instead querying the implementing object types/fields in Apollo Router via inline fragments for example. A fix to versions 2.9.5 2.10.4 2.11.5 and 2.12.1 of composition logic in Federation now disallows interfaces types and fields to contain user-defined access control directives. Some workarounds are available. Users of Apollo Rover with an unpatched composition version or are using the Apollo Studio build pipeline with Federation version 2.8 or below should manually copy the access control requirements on interface types/fields to each implementing object type/field where appropriate. Do not remove those access control requirements from the interface types/fields as unpatched Apollo Composition will not automatically generate them in the supergraph schema. Customers not using Apollo Router access control features (`@authenticated` `@requiresScopes` or `@policy` directives) or not specifying access control requirements on interface types/fields are not affected and do not need to take action.,7.5,CWE-288

CVE-2024-5443,CVE-2024-4320 describes a vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms software specifically within the `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()` function. The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder` parameters accepting empty strings (``) which due to inadequate input sanitization can lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path this path can be appended to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0 and has been addressed in version 9.8.,9.8,CWE-29

CVE-2025-32798,Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.4.0 the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result the integrity of the build environment is compromised and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.,9.8,CWE-94

CVE-2023-1998,The Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations by calling prctl with PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the speculation feature as well as by using seccomp. We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.  This happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS) the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However with legacy IBRS the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace due to performance reasons which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.,5.6,CWE-1303

Prior to 9.5.5 9.6.3 and 9.7.3 go-redis potentially responds out of order when `CLIENT SETINFO` times out during connection establishment. This can happen when the client is configured to transmit its identity there are network connectivity issues or the client was configured with aggressive timeouts. The problem occurs for multiple use cases. For sticky connections you receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the connection. All commands in the pipeline receive incorrect responses. When used with the default ConnPool once a connection is returned after use with ConnPool#Put the read buffer will be checked and the connection will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means that at most one out-of-order response before the connection is discarded. This issue is fixed in 9.5.5 9.6.3 and 9.7.3. You can prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag DisableIndentity to true when constructing the client instance.,3.7,CWE-20

CVE-2024-58099,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame  Andrew and Nikolay reported connectivity issues with Cilium's service load-balancing in case of vmxnet3.  If a BPF program for native XDP adds an encapsulation header such as IPIP and transmits the packet out the same interface then in case of vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped on the path.  vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp() through vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect DMA address:    page = virt_to_page(xdpf->data);   tbi->dma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +                   VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM;   dma_sync_single_for_device(&adapter->pdev->dev                              tbi->dma_addr buf_size                              DMA_TO_DEVICE);  The above assumes a fixed offset (VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM) but the XDP BPF program could have moved xdp->data. While the passed buf_size is correct (xdpf->len) the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which can be calculated as xdpf->data - (void *)xdpf that is xdp->data - xdp->data_hard_start.,5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2024-32017,RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of devices that are typically 8-bit 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. The size check in the `gcoap_dns_server_proxy_get()` function contains a small typo that may lead to a buffer overflow in the subsequent `strcpy()`. In detail the length of the `_uri` string is checked instead of the length of the `_proxy` string.
