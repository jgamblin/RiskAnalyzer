CVE-2022-48791,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted TMF sas_task  Currently a use-after-free may occur if a TMF sas_task is aborted before we handle the IO completion in mpi_ssp_completion(). The abort occurs due to timeout.  When the timeout occurs the SAS_TASK_STATE_ABORTED flag is set and the sas_task is freed in pm8001_exec_internal_tmf_task().  However if the I/O completion occurs later the I/O completion still thinks that the sas_task is available. Fix this by clearing the ccb->task if the TMF times out - the I/O completion handler does nothing if this pointer is cleared.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-37269,Winter is a free open-source content management system (CMS) based on the Laravel PHP framework. Users with the `backend.manage_branding` permission can upload SVGs as the application logo. Prior to version 1.2.3 SVG uploads were not sanitized which could have allowed a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. To exploit the vulnerability an attacker would already need to have developer or super user level permissions in Winter CMS. This means they would already have extensive access and control within the system. Additionally to execute the XSS the attacker would need to convince the victim to directly visit the URL of the maliciously uploaded SVG and the application would have to be using local storage where uploaded files are served under the same domain as the application itself instead of a CDN. This is because all SVGs in Winter CMS are rendered through an `img` tag which prevents any payloads from being executed directly. These two factors significantly limit the potential harm of this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in v1.2.3 through the inclusion of full support for SVG uploads and automatic sanitization of uploaded SVG files. As a workaround one may apply the patches manually.,2.0,CWE-79

CVE-2024-28255,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.,9.8,CWE-287

CVE-2024-41006,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netrom: Fix a memory leak in nr_heartbeat_expiry()  syzbot reported a memory leak in nr_create() [0].  Commit 409db27e3a2e (netrom: Fix use-after-free of a listening socket.) added sock_hold() to the nr_heartbeat_expiry() function where a) a socket has a SOCK_DESTROY flag or b) a listening socket has a SOCK_DEAD flag.  But in the case a when the SOCK_DESTROY flag is set the file descriptor has already been closed and the nr_release() function has been called.

CVE-2022-24815,JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate develop & deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures. SQL Injection vulnerability in entities for applications generated with the option reactive with Spring WebFlux enabled and an SQL database using r2dbc. Applications created without reactive with Spring WebFlux and applications with NoSQL databases are not affected. Users who have generated a microservice Gateway using the affected version may be impacted as Gateways are reactive by default. Currently SQL injection is possible in the findAllBy(Pageable pageable Criteria criteria) method of an entity repository class generated in these applications as the where clause using Criteria for queries are not sanitized and user input is passed on as it is by the criteria. This issue has been patched in v7.8.1. Users unable to upgrade should be careful when combining criterias and conditions as the root of the issue lies in the `EntityManager.java` class when creating the where clause via `Conditions.just(criteria.toString())`. `just` accepts the literal string provided. Criteria's `toString` method returns a plain string and this combination is vulnerable to sql injection as the string is not sanitized and will contain whatever used passed as input using any plain SQL.,8.1,CWE-89

CVE-2025-48952,NetAlertX is a network presence scanner and alert framework. Prior to version 25.6.7 a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted magic hash values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===` different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e. zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain weird passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability.,9.4,CWE-697

CVE-2025-49600,In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4 mbedtls_lms_verify may accept invalid signatures if hash computation fails and internal errors go unchecked enabling LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) forgery in a fault scenario. Specifically unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable.
