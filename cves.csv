CVE-2024-26710,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB  KASAN is seen to increase stack usage to the point that it was reported to lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).  To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in commit 3e8635fb2e07 (powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with KASAN).  However with a 32KB stack size to begin with the doubling leads to a 64KB stack which causes build errors:   arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)  Although the asm could be reworked in practice a 32KB stack seems sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.  So only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB.,5.5,CWE-770

CVE-2024-28254,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `‎AlertUtil::validateExpression` method evaluates an SpEL expression using `getValue` which by default uses the `StandardEvaluationContext` allowing the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as `java.lang.Runtime` leading to Remote Code Execution. The `/api/v1/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/<expression>` endpoint passes user-controlled data `AlertUtil::validateExpession` allowing authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlaying operating system. In addition there is a missing authorization check since `Authorizer.authorize()` is never called in the affected path and therefore any authenticated non-admin user is able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary SpEL expressions leading to arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-235`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.8,CWE-78

CVE-2024-55553,In FRRouting (FRR) before 10.3 from 6.0 onward all routes are re-validated if the total size of an update received via RTR exceeds the internal socket's buffer size default 4K on most OSes. An attacker can use this to trigger re-parsing of the RIB for FRR routers using RTR by causing more than this number of updates during an update interval (usually 30 minutes). Additionally this effect regularly occurs organically. Furthermore an attacker can use this to trigger route validation continuously. Given that routers with large full tables may need more than 30 minutes to fully re-validate the table continuous issuance/withdrawal of large numbers of ROA may be used to impact the route handling performance of all FRR instances using RPKI globally. Additionally the re-validation will cause heightened BMP traffic to ingestors. Fixed Versions: 10.0.3 10.1.2 10.2.1 >= 10.3.,7.5,CWE-404

CVE-2022-48909,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: fix connection leak  There's a potential leak issue under following execution sequence :  smc_release  				smc_connect_work if (sk->sk_state == SMC_INIT) 					send_clc_confirim 	tcp_abort(); 					... 					sk.sk_state = SMC_ACTIVE smc_close_active switch(sk->sk_state) { ... case SMC_ACTIVE: 	smc_close_final() 	// then wait peer closed  Unfortunately tcp_abort() may discard CLC CONFIRM messages that are still in the tcp send buffer in which case our connection token cannot be delivered to the server side which means that we cannot get a passive close message at all. Therefore it is impossible for the to be disconnected at all.  This patch tries a very simple way to avoid this issue once the state has changed to SMC_ACTIVE after tcp_abort() we can actively abort the smc connection considering that the state is SMC_INIT before tcp_abort() abandoning the complete disconnection process should not cause too much problem.  In fact this problem may exist as long as the CLC CONFIRM message is not received by the server. Whether a timer should be added after smc_close_final() needs to be discussed in the future. But even so this patch provides a faster release for connection in above case it should also be valuable.,5.5,CWE-401
