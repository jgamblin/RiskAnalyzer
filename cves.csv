CVE-2023-48219,TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s core undo/redo functionality and other APIs and plugins. Text nodes within specific parents are not escaped upon serialization according to the HTML standard. If such text nodes contain a special character reserved as an internal marker they can be combined with other HTML patterns to form malicious snippets. These snippets pass the initial sanitisation layer when the content is parsed into the editor body but can trigger XSS when the special internal marker is removed from the content and re-parsed. his vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE versions 6.7.3 and 5.10.9.

CVE-2023-40176,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can exploit a stored XSS through their user profile by setting the payload as the value of the time zone user preference. Even though the time zone is selected from a drop down (no free text value) it can still be set from JavaScript (using the browser developer tools) or by calling the save URL on the user profile with the right query string. Once the time zone is set it is displayed without escaping which means the payload gets executed for any user that visits the malicious user profile allowing the attacker to steal information and even gain more access rights (escalation to programming rights). This issue is present since version 4.1M2 when the time zone user preference was introduced. The issue has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1.,9.0,CWE-79

CVE-2025-21742,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usbnet: ipheth: use static NDP16 location in URB  Original code allowed for the start of NDP16 to be anywhere within the URB based on the `wNdpIndex` value in NTH16. Only the start position of NDP16 was checked so it was possible for even the fixed-length part of NDP16 to extend past the end of URB leading to an out-of-bounds read.  On iOS devices the NDP16 header always directly follows NTH16. Rely on and check for this specific format.  This along with NCM-specific minimal URB length check that already exists will ensure that the fixed-length part of NDP16 plus a set amount of DPEs fit within the URB.  Note that this commit alone does not fully address the OoB read. The limit on the amount of DPEs needs to be enforced separately.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2024-55923,TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework. A vulnerability has been identified in the backend user interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically this functionality is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally state-changing actions in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not enforce the appropriate HTTP method. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and to be deceived into interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend which can occur under the following conditions: The user opens a malicious link such as one sent via email. The user visits a compromised or manipulated website while the following settings are misconfigured: 1. `security.backend.enforceReferrer` feature is disabled 2. `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to lax or none. The vulnerability in the affected downstream component “Indexed Search Module” allows attackers to delete items of the component. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 11.5.42 ELTS 12.4.25 LTS 13.4.3 LTS which fix the problem described. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,4.3,CWE-352
CVE-2022-31245,mailcow before 2022-05d allows a remote authenticated user to inject OS commands and escalate privileges to domain admin via the --debug option in conjunction with the ---PIPEMESS option in Sync Jobs.,8.8,CWE-78
CVE-2024-24824,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 arbitrary classes can be loaded and instantiated using a HTTP PUT request to the `/api/system/cluster_config/` endpoint. Graylog's cluster config system uses fully qualified class names as config keys. To validate the existence of the requested class before using them Graylog loads the class using the class loader. If a user with the appropriate permissions performs the request arbitrary classes with 1-arg String constructors can be instantiated. This will execute arbitrary code that is run during class instantiation. In the specific use case of `java.io.File` the behavior of the internal web-server stack will lead to information exposure by including the entire file content in the response to the REST request. Versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 contain a fix for this issue.,8.8,CWE-284
CVE-2024-32001,SpiceDB is a graph database purpose-built for storing and evaluating access control data. Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder->view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for either `folder` or `folder#parent`. This bug only manifests if the same subject type is used multiple types in a relation relationships exist for both subject types and an arrow is used over the relation. Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected. Version 1.30.1 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema. ,2.2,CWE-755

CVE-2022-35740,dotCMS before 22.06 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access control and obtain sensitive information by using a semicolon in a URL to introduce a matrix parameter. (This is also fixed in 5.3.8.12 21.06.9 and 22.03.2 for LTS users.) Some Java application frameworks including those used by Spring or Tomcat allow the use of matrix parameters: these are URI parameters separated by semicolons. Through precise semicolon placement in a URI it is possible to exploit this feature to avoid dotCMS's path-based XSS prevention (such as require login filters) and consequently access restricted resources. For example an attacker could place a semicolon immediately before a / character that separates elements of a filesystem path. This could reveal file content that is ordinarily only visible to signed-in users. This issue can be chained with other exploit code to achieve XSS attacks against dotCMS.,6.1,CWE-79
