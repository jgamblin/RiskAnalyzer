CVE-2024-35827,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()  The controllen variable is type size_t (unsigned long).  Casting it to int could lead to an integer underflow.  The check_add_overflow() function considers the type of the destination which is type int.  If we add two positive values and the result cannot fit in an integer then that's counted as an overflow.  However if we cast controllen to an int and it turns negative then negative values *can* fit into an int type so there is no overflow.  Good: 100 + (unsigned long)-4 = 96  <-- overflow  Bad: 100 + (int)-4 = 96 <-- no overflow  I deleted the cast of the sizeof() as well.  That's not a bug but the cast is unnecessary.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2024-46689,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC not WB  Linux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is write protected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache eviction as write into the write protected region leading to secure interrupt which causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.  The only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisor maps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translation tables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like Xen or KVM) which does not know anything about those specific mappings.  Changing the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC removes dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patch fixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.  I tested this on SA8155P with Xen.,5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2024-57953,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: tps6594: Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems  The problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset()  	tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;  The tmp variable is an s64 but offset is a long in the (-277774)-277774 range.  On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to approximately two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large (32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million.  When you start multiplying by a hundred million it doesn't take long to overflow the two billion mark.  Probably the safest way to fix this is to change the type of TICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because it's such a large number.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2025-21915,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cdx: Fix possible UAF error in driver_override_show()  Fixed a possible UAF problem in driver_override_show() in drivers/cdx/cdx.c  This function driver_override_show() is part of DEVICE_ATTR_RW which includes both driver_override_show() and driver_override_store(). These functions can be executed concurrently in sysfs.  The driver_override_store() function uses driver_set_override() to update the driver_override value and driver_set_override() internally locks the device (device_lock(dev)). If driver_override_show() reads cdx_dev->driver_override without locking it could potentially access a freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string concurrently. This could lead to printing a kernel address which is a security risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read by all users.  Additionally a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c as well as many other bus drivers where device_lock() is taken in the show function and it has been working without issues.  This potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis tool which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify data races and atomicity violations.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-46870,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35  [Why] DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.  Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which works fine for ASIC without IPS but with IPS this could lead to a race condition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined state.  [How] We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected but for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race condition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog timeout are minimal.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2024-1931,NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1 contain a vulnerability that can cause denial of service by a certain code path that can lead to an infinite loop. Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client's advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition the code that trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered when the 'ede: yes' option is used; non default configuration. From version 1.19.2 on the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.,7.5,CWE-835

CVE-2024-56740,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs/localio: must clear res.replen in nfs_local_read_done  Otherwise memory corruption can occur due to NFSv3 LOCALIO reads leaving garbage in res.replen: - nfs3_read_done() copies that into server->read_hdrsize; from there   nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests. - nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()   which includes it in hdrsize for xdr_init_pages so that rq_rcv_buf   contains a ridiculous len. - This is copied to rq_private_buf and xs_read_stream_request()   eventually passes the kvec to sock_recvmsg() which receives incoming   data into entirely the wrong place.  This is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads when it is made to pivot back to using normal RPC.  This switch back to using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this issue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3 server while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO.,7.8,CWE-787
CVE-2025-47287,Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0 are affected. The vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to Tornado version 6.50 to receive a patch. As a workaround risk can be mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in a proxy.,7.5,CWE-770
CVE-2024-8268,The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized code execution due to insufficient filtering on callable methods/functions via the ajax_request() function in all versions up to and including 2.2.4.
