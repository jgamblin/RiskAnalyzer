CVE-2024-24823,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id even if for different user credentials. In this case the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an attack is high because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 and any versions of the 6.0 development branch contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists but is relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions` endpoint as that is the only one vulnerable.,5.7,CWE-384

CVE-2025-53098,Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. The project-specific MCP configuration for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace. Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands prior to version 3.20.3 it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project this would have led to arbitrary command execution. This issue is of moderate severity since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack) for the user to have MCP enabled (on by default) and for the user to have enabled auto-approved file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files including all files within the `.roo/` folder.,8.1,CWE-77

CVE-2024-39476,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid5: fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING  Xiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with small possibility the root cause is exactly the same as commit bed9e27baf52 (Revert md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d)  However Dan reported another hang after that and junxiao investigated the problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio can't issue from raid5d().  Current implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence:  1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold 'reconfig_mutex' to clear    MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING; 2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop until all IO are issued; 3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;  This behaviour is introduce before v2.6 and for consequence if other context hold 'reconfig_mutex' and md_check_recovery() can't update super_block then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop until 'reconfig_mutex' is released.  Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10 fix this problem by skipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after md_check_recovery() daemon thread will be woken up when 'reconfig_mutex' is released. Meanwhile the hang problem will be fixed as well.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-42316,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()  evict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through page writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass since folio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the isolation.  The second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting scan_control->nr_scanned.  However this can result in underflow of nr_scanned under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment nr_scanned i.e. when folio_trylock() fails.  The underflow can cause the divisor i.e. scale=scanned+reclaimed in vmpressure_calc_level() to become zero resulting in the following crash:    [exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101]   process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b  Since scan_control->nr_scanned has no established semantics the potential double counting has minimal risks.

CVE-2022-49661,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: gs_usb: gs_usb_open/close(): fix memory leak  The gs_usb driver appears to suffer from a malady common to many USB CAN adapter drivers in that it performs usb_alloc_coherent() to allocate a number of USB request blocks (URBs) for RX and then later relies on usb_kill_anchored_urbs() to free them but this doesn't actually free them. As a result this may be leaking DMA memory that's been used by the driver.  This commit is an adaptation of the techniques found in the esd_usb2 driver where a similar design pattern led to a memory leak. It explicitly frees the RX URBs and their DMA memory via a call to usb_free_coherent(). Since the RX URBs were allocated in the gs_can_open() we remove them in gs_can_close() rather than in the disconnect function as was done in esd_usb2.  For more information see the 928150fad41b (can: esd_usb2: fix memory leak).,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-51504,When using IPAuthenticationProvider in ZooKeeper Admin Server there is a possibility of Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -- this only impacts IP based authentication implemented in ZooKeeper Admin Server. Default configuration of client's IP address detection in IPAuthenticationProvider which uses HTTP request headers is weak and allows an attacker to bypass authentication via spoofing client's IP address in request headers. Default configuration honors X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to read client's IP address. X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy servers to identify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretending that the request comes from a different IP address. Admin Server commands such as snapshot and restore arbitrarily can be executed on successful exploitation which could potentially lead to information leakage or service availability issues.

CVE-2025-22100,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor: Fix race condition when gathering fdinfo group samples  Commit e16635d88fa0 (drm/panthor: add DRM fdinfo support) failed to protect access to groups with an xarray lock which could lead to use-after-free errors.,4.7,CWE-362
CVE-2023-4571,In Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) versions below below 4.13.3 4.15.3 or 4.17.1 a malicious actor can inject American National Standards Institute (ANSI) escape codes into Splunk ITSI log files that when a vulnerable terminal application reads them can run malicious code in the vulnerable application. This attack requires a user to use a terminal application that translates ANSI escape codes to read the malicious log file locally in the vulnerable terminal. The vulnerability also requires additional user interaction to succeed.   The vulnerability does not directly affect Splunk ITSI. The indirect impact on Splunk ITSI can vary significantly depending on the permissions in the vulnerable terminal application as well as where and how the user reads the malicious log file. For example users can copy the malicious file from Splunk ITSI and read it on their local machine.,8.6,CWE-117
