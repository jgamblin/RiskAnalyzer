CVE-2023-39348,Spinnaker is an open source multi-cloud continuous delivery platform. Log output when updating GitHub status is improperly set to FULL always.  It's recommended to apply the patch and rotate the GitHub token used for github status notifications.  Given that this would output github tokens to a log system the risk is slightly higher than a low since token exposure could grant elevated access to repositories outside of control.  If using READ restricted tokens the exposure is such that the token itself could be used to access resources otherwise restricted from reads. This only affects users of GitHub Status Notifications. This issue has been addressed in pull request 1316. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable GH Status Notifications Filter their logs for Echo log data and use read-only tokens that are limited in scope.,4.0,CWE-532

CVE-2023-39347,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. An attacker with the ability to update pod labels can cause Cilium to apply incorrect network policies. This issue arises due to the fact that on pod update Cilium incorrectly uses user-provided pod labels to select the policies which apply to the workload in question. This can affect Cilium network policies that use the namespace service account or cluster constructs to restrict traffic Cilium clusterwide network policies that use Cilium namespace labels to select the Pod and Kubernetes network policies. Non-existent construct names can be provided which bypass all network policies applicable to the construct. For example providing a pod with a non-existent namespace as the value of the `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` label results in none of the namespaced CiliumNetworkPolicies applying to the pod in question. This attack requires the attacker to have Kubernetes API Server access as described in the Cilium Threat Model. This issue has been resolved in: Cilium versions 1.14.2 1.13.7 and 1.12.14. Users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround an admission webhook can be used to prevent pod label updates to the `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` and `io.cilium.k8s.policy.*` keys.,7.6,CWE-345

CVE-2023-41885,Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.

CVE-2022-24900,Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the malicious parameter represents an absolute path the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.,9.9,CWE-22

CVE-2024-43804,Roxy-WI is a web interface for managing Haproxy Nginx Apache and Keepalived servers. An OS Command Injection vulnerability allows any authenticated user on the application to execute arbitrary code on the web application server via port scanning functionality. User-supplied input is used without validation when constructing and executing an OS command. User supplied JSON POST data is parsed and if id JSON key does not exist JSON value supplied via ip JSON key is assigned to the ip variable. Later on ip variable which can be controlled by the attacker is used when constructing the cmd and cmd1 strings without any extra validation. Then server_mod.subprocess_execute function is called on both cmd1 and cmd2. When the definition of the server_mod.subprocess_execute() function is analyzed it can be seen that subprocess.Popen() is called on the input parameter with shell=True which results in OS Command Injection.

CVE-2023-52517,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drain  Previously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to read any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is correct when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the transfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be transferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO still needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure and DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO corrupting any data read. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never adjusted according to DMA progress in DMA mode thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA mode is a bug. Fix corruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode. Also wait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to ensure all data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.,7.0,CWE-362

CVE-2023-30541,OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. A function in the implementation contract may be inaccessible if its selector clashes with one of the proxy's own selectors.

The probability of an accidental clash is negligible but one could be caused deliberately and could cause a reduction in availability. The issue has been fixed in version 4.8.3. As a workaround if a function appears to be inaccessible for this reason it may be possible to craft the calldata such that ABI decoding does not fail at the proxy and the function is properly proxied through.,5.3,CWE-436

CVE-2022-48872,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free race condition for maps  It is possible that in between calling fastrpc_map_get() until map->fl->lock is taken in fastrpc_free_map() another thread can call fastrpc_map_lookup() and get a reference to a map that is about to be deleted.  Rewrite fastrpc_map_get() to only increase the reference count of a map if it's non-zero. Propagate this to callers so they can know if a map is about to be deleted.  Fixes this warning: refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free. WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 10100 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate ...

CVE-2024-39480,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kdb: Fix buffer overflow during tab-complete  Currently when the user attempts symbol completion with the Tab key kdb will use strncpy() to insert the completed symbol into the command buffer. Unfortunately it passes the size of the source buffer rather than the destination to strncpy() with predictably horrible results. Most obviously if the command buffer is already full but cp the cursor position is in the middle of the buffer then we will write past the end of the supplied buffer.  Fix this by replacing the dubious strncpy() calls with memmove()/memcpy() calls plus explicit boundary checks to make sure we have enough space before we start moving characters around.,7.8,CWE-120
