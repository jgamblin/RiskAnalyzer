CVE-2023-46252,Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. Affected versions are missing origin verification in a postMessage handler which introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The editor-sdk.js file defines three different class-like functions which employ a global message event listener: SquidexSidebar SquidexWidget and SquidexFormField. The registered event listener takes some action based on the type of the received message. For example when the SquidexFormField receives a message with the type valueChanged the value property is updated. The SquidexFormField class is for example used in the editor-editorjs.html file which can be accessed via the public wwwroot folder. It uses the onValueChanged method to register a callback function which passes the value provided from the message event to the editor.render. Passing an attacker-controlled value to this function introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.,6.8,CWE-79

CVE-2023-26481,authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Due to an insufficient access check a recovery flow link that is created by an admin (or sent via email by an admin) can be used to set the password for any arbitrary user. This attack is only possible if a recovery flow exists which has both an Identification and an Email stage bound to it. If the flow has policies on the identification stage to skip it when the flow is restored (by checking `request.context['is_restored']`) the flow is not affected by this. With this flow in place an administrator must create a recovery Link or send a recovery URL to the attacker who can due to the improper validation of the token create set the password for any account. Regardless for custom recovery flows it is recommended to add a policy that checks if the flow is restored and skips the identification stage. This issue has been fixed in versions 2023.2.3 2023.1.3 and 2022.12.2. ,9.1,CWE-345

CVE-2025-23028,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. A denial of service vulnerability affects versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7 1.15.0 through 1.15.11 and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4. In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS traffic an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads from outside the cluster. For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads that have DNS-based policy configured existing connections may continue to operate and new connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established but new connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to restart. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18 v1.15.12 and v1.16.5. No known workarounds are available.,5.3,CWE-770

CVE-2023-37579,Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Pulsar Function Worker.  This issue affects Apache Pulsar: before 2.10.4 and 2.11.0.  Any authenticated user can retrieve a source's configuration or a sink's configuration without authorization. Many sources and sinks contain credentials in the configuration which could lead to leaked credentials. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that there is not a known way for an authenticated user to enumerate another tenant's sources or sinks meaning the source or sink name would need to be guessed in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The recommended mitigation for impacted users is to upgrade the Pulsar Function Worker to a patched version.  2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.4. 2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1. 3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users are unaffected. Any users running the Pulsar Function Worker for 2.9.* and earlier should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.  ,8.2,CWE-863

CVE-2023-28436,Tailscale is software for using Wireguard and multi-factor authentication (MFA). A vulnerability identified in the implementation of Tailscale SSH starting in version 1.34.0 and prior to prior to 1.38.2 in FreeBSD allows commands to be run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules. A difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD `setgroups` system call from POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based operating system did not appropriately restrict groups on the host when using Tailscale SSH. When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.  Tailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria: the destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled; Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and a non-interactive SSH session was used.  Affected users should upgrade to version 1.38.2 to remediate the issue.  ,5.7,CWE-269

CVE-2022-3643,Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core resulting in said misbehavior.,6.5,CWE-74

CVE-2024-52298,macro-pdfviewer is a PDF Viewer Macro for XWiki using Mozilla pdf.js. The PDF Viewer macro allows an attacker to view any attachment using the Delegate my view right feature as long as the attacker can view a page whose last author has access to the attachment.

CVE-2024-1635,A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point depending on the amount of memory available.     At HTTP upgrade to remoting the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task the whole dependency tree leaks via that task which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit which contains the connections and causes the leak.,7.5,CWE-400
