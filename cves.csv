CVE-2024-47167,Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability relates to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** in the `/queue/join` endpoint. Gradio’s `async_save_url_to_cache` function allows attackers to force the Gradio server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable attackers to target internal servers or services within a local network and possibly exfiltrate data or cause unwanted internal requests. Additionally the content from these URLs is stored locally making it easier for attackers to upload potentially malicious files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers that use components like the Video component which involve URL fetching. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.  As a workaround users can disable or heavily restrict URL-based inputs in their Gradio applications to trusted domains only. Additionally implementing stricter URL validation (such as allowinglist-based validation) and ensuring that local or internal network addresses cannot be requested via the `/queue/join` endpoint can help mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks.,9.8,CWE-918

CVE-2022-29219,Lodestar is a TypeScript implementation of the Ethereum Consensus specification. Prior to version 0.36.0 there is a possible consensus split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain. Because the developers represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s there is an issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain. In those cases Lodestar may view valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as invalid due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus split where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network. Similarly Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as valid thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases so one may carefully use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus.,7.5,CWE-190

CVE-2024-37155,OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9 the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace carriage return and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.,6.5,CWE-284

For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.,6.1,CWE-200
