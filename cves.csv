CVE-2024-42352,Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. `nuxt/icon` provides an API to allow client side icon lookup. This endpoint is at `/api/_nuxt_icon/[name]`. The proxied request path is improperly parsed allowing an attacker to change the scheme and host of the request. This leads to SSRF and could potentially lead to sensitive data exposure. The `new URL` constructor is used to parse the final path. This constructor can be passed a relative scheme or path in order to change the host the request is sent to. This constructor is also very tolerant of poorly formatted URLs. As a result we can pass a path prefixed with the string `http:`. This has the effect of changing the scheme to HTTP. We can then subsequently pass a new host for example `http:127.0.0.1:8080`. This would allow us to send requests to a local server. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.4.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.6,CWE-918

CVE-2021-47506,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race  A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation it will be freed as soon as the callback is done with it without ever being removed from del_recall_lru.  Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings usually in the laundromat thread.  I suspect aba2072f4523 nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding writes made this bug easier to hit but I looked as far back as v3.0 and it looks to me it already had the same problem.

CVE-2023-29011,Git for Windows the Windows port of Git ships with an executable called `connect.exe` which implements a SOCKS5 proxy that can be used to connect e.g. to SSH servers via proxies when certain ports are blocked for outgoing connections. The location of `connect.exe`'s config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\etc\connectrc`. Since `C:\etc` can be created by any authenticated user this makes `connect.exe` susceptible to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git commands are run and remove read/write access from those folders. Alternatively watch out for malicious `<drive>:\etc\connectrc` files on multi-user machines.,7.5,CWE-427

CVE-2022-30312,The Trend Controls IC protocol through 2022-05-06 allows Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. According to FSCT-2022-0050 there is a Trend Controls Inter-Controller (IC) protocol cleartext transmission of credentials issue. The affected components are characterized as: Inter-Controller (IC) protocol (57612/UDP). The potential impact is: Compromise of credentials. Several Trend Controls building automation controllers utilize the Inter-Controller (IC) protocol in for information exchange and automation purposes.

CVE-2022-31098,Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations aka KubeConfg of registered Kubernetes clusters including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters.

CVE-2023-47630,Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. An issue was found in Kyverno that allowed an attacker to control the digest of images used by Kyverno users. The issue would require the attacker to compromise the registry that the Kyverno users fetch their images from. The attacker could then return an vulnerable image to the the user and leverage that to further escalate their position. As such the attacker would need to know which images the Kyverno user consumes and know of one of multiple exploitable vulnerabilities in previous digests of the images. Alternatively if the attacker has compromised the registry they could craft a malicious image with a different digest with intentionally placed vulnerabilities and deliver the image to the user.  Users pulling their images by digests and from trusted registries are not impacted by this vulnerability. There is no evidence of this being exploited in the wild. The issue has been patched in 1.10.5. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.1,CWE-345

CVE-2024-31991,Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0 the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server. Based on the content of the response it will either parse the content or disregard it. This function nor those that call it add any restrictions on the URL that can be provided nor is it restricted to being an FQDN (i.e. an IP address can be provided). As this function’s return will be handled differently by its caller depending on the response it is possible for an attacker to use this functionality to positively identify HTTP(s) servers on the local network with any IP/port combination. This issue can result in any authenticated user being able to map HTTP servers on a local network that the Mealie service has access to. Note that by default any user can create an account on a Mealie server and that the default changeme@example.com user is available with its hard-coded password.

CVE-2025-25286,Crayfish is a collection of Islandora 8 microservices one of which Homarus provides FFmpeg as a microservice. Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0 remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.,9.8,CWE-150

CVE-2025-27610,Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13 3.0.14 and 3.1.12 `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13 3.0.14 and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static` or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.,7.5,CWE-23
