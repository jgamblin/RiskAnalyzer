CVE-2024-26729,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srv  Fixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in the dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() functions.  In both functions the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferenced before it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.  Thus moving the null checks for 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of the functions to ensure that 'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it is dereferenced.

CVE-2024-58007,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial number  On MSM8916 devices the serial number exposed in sysfs is constant and does not change across individual devices. It's always:    db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ cat serial_number   2644893864  The firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0 8) which does not have support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is an existing check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case but it's not correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM we need to make sure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds instead of comparing with the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916 devices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfo struct in SMEM.  Fix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend() so that the size of the field is also taken into account.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2023-39517,Joplin is a free open source note taking and to-do application. A Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in affected versions allows clicking on an untrusted image link to execute arbitrary shell commands. The HTML sanitizer (`packages/renderer/htmlUtils.ts::sanitizeHtml`) preserves `<map>` `<area>` links. However unlike `<a>` links the `target` and `href` attributes are not removed. Additionally because the note preview pane isn't sandboxed to prevent top navigation links with `target` set to `_top` can replace the toplevel electron page. Because any toplevel electron page with Joplin's setup has access to `require` and can require node libraries a malicious replacement toplevel page can import `child_process` and execute arbitrary shell commands.

CVE-2025-32968,XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 1.6-milestone-1 to before 15.10.16 16.4.6 and 16.10.1 it is possible for a user with SCRIPT right to escape from the HQL execution context and perform a blind SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database backend. Depending on the used database backend the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries. This issue has been patched in versions 16.10.1 16.4.6 and 15.10.16. There is no known workaround other than upgrading XWiki. The protection added to this REST API is the same as the one used to validate complete select queries making it more consistent. However while the script API always had this protection for complete queries it's important to note that it's a very strict protection and some valid but complex queries might suddenly require the author to have programming right.,8.8,CWE-89

CVE-2024-29069,In snapd versions prior to 2.62 snapd failed to properly check the destination of symbolic links when extracting a snap. The snap format  is a squashfs file-system image and so can contain symbolic links and other file types. Various file entries within the snap squashfs image (such as icons and desktop files etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which contained symbolic links at these paths could then  cause snapd to write out the contents of the symbolic link destination into a world-readable directory. This in-turn could allow an unprivileged user to gain access to privileged information.,4.8,CWE-610

CVE-2024-45307,SudoBot a Discord moderation bot is vulnerable to privilege escalation and exploit of the `-config` command in versions prior to 9.26.7. Anyone is theoretically able to update any configuration of the bot and potentially gain control over the bot's settings. Every version of v9 before v9.26.7 is affected. Other versions (e.g. v8) are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 9.26.7 to receive a patch. A workaround would be to create a command permission overwrite in the Database. A SQL statement provided in the GitHub Security Advisor can be executed to create a overwrite that disallows users without `ManageGuild` permission to run the `-config` command. Run the SQL statement for every server the bot is in and replace `<guild_id>` with the appropriate Guild ID each time.,8.8,CWE-285

CVE-2024-28898,Secure Boot Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability,6.3,CWE-121
CVE-2023-43634, When sealing/unsealing the “vault” key a list of PCRs is used which defines which PCRs are used.  In a previous project CYMOTIVE found that the configuration is not protected by the secure boot and in response Zededa implemented measurements on the config partition that was mapped to PCR 13.  In that process PCR 13 was added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key.  In commit “56e589749c6ff58ded862d39535d43253b249acf” the config partition measurement moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14 but PCR 14 was not added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key.  This change makes the measurement of PCR 14 effectively redundant as it would not affect the sealing/unsealing of the key.    An attacker could modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot this could result in the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents of the encrypted “vault”     ,8.8,CWE-522
CVE-2023-52497,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression  Currently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplace decompression that was used to handle the cases that some pages of compressed data are actually not in-place I/O.  However like most simple LZ77 algorithms LZ4 expects the compressed data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and it explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:   __________________________________________________________  |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|  Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this it typically maps two individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain. Previously it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem to completely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reported that EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor. After some analysis it seems that recent x86 processors with the new FSRM feature expose this issue with rep movsb.  Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace decompression for now.  Later as an useful improvement we could try to tie up these two buffers together in the correct order.,6.1,CWE-787
