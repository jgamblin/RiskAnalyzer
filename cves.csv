CVE-2022-29184,GoCD is a continuous delivery server. In GoCD versions prior to 22.1.0 it is possible for existing authenticated users who have permissions to edit or create pipeline materials or pipeline configuration repositories to get remote code execution capability on the GoCD server via configuring a malicious branch name which abuses Mercurial hooks/aliases to exploit a command injection weakness. An attacker would require access to an account with existing GoCD administration permissions to either create/edit (`hg`-based) configuration repositories; create/edit pipelines and their (`hg`-based) materials; or where pipelines-as-code configuration repositories are used to commit malicious configuration to such an external repository which will be automatically parsed into a pipeline configuration and (`hg`) material definition by the GoCD server. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.1.0. As a workaround users who do not use/rely upon Mercurial materials can uninstall/remove the `hg`/Mercurial binary from the underlying GoCD Server operating system or Docker image.,8.8,CWE-77

CVE-2024-50186,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: explicitly clear the sk pointer when pf->create fails  We have recently noticed the exact same KASAN splat as in commit 6cd4a78d962b (net: do not leave a dangling sk pointer when socket creation fails). The problem is that commit did not fully address the problem as some pf->create implementations do not use sk_common_release in their error paths.  For example we can use the same reproducer as in the above commit but changing ping to arping. arping uses AF_PACKET socket and if packet_create fails it will just sk_free the allocated sk object.  While we could chase all the pf->create implementations and make sure they NULL the freed sk object on error from the socket we can't guarantee future protocols will not make the same mistake.  So it is easier to just explicitly NULL the sk pointer upon return from pf->create in __sock_create. We do know that pf->create always releases the allocated sk object on error so if the pointer is not NULL it is definitely dangling.,7.8,CWE-416
CVE-2024-58063,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtlwifi: fix memory leaks and invalid access at probe error path  Deinitialize at reverse order when probe fails.

CVE-2024-43801,Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. The Jellyfin user profile image upload accepts SVG files allowing for a stored XSS attack against an admin user via a specially crafted malicious SVG file. When viewed by an admin outside of the Jellyfin Web UI (e.g. via view image in a browser) this malicious SVG file could interact with the browser's LocalStorage and retrieve an AccessToken which in turn can be used in an API call to elevate the target user to a Jellyfin administrator. The actual attack vector is unlikely to be exploited as it requires specific actions by the administrator to view the SVG image outside of Jellyfin's WebUI i.e. it is not a passive attack. The underlying exploit mechanism is solved by PR #12490 which forces attached images (including the potential malicious SVG) to be treated as attachments and thus downloaded by browsers rather than viewed. This prevents exploitation of the LocalStorage of the browser. This PR has been merged and the relevant code changes are included in release version 10.9.10. All users are advised to upgrade.,4.6,CWE-200

CVE-2025-24363,The HL7 FHIR IG publisher is a tool to take a set of inputs and create a standard FHIR IG.

This does not impact users that clone public repos without credentials such as those using the auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure. This problem has been patched in release 1.8.9. Some workarounds are available. Users should ensure the IG repo they are publishing does not have username or credentials included in the `origin` URL. Running the command `git remote origin url` should return a URL that contains no username password or token; or users should run the IG Publisher CLI with the `-repo` parameter and specify a URL that contains no username password or token.,4.2,CWE-200

CVE-2022-46152,OP-TEE Trusted OS is the secure side implementation of OP-TEE project a Trusted Execution Environment. Versions prior to 3.19.0 contain an Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability. The function `cleanup_shm_refs()` is called by both `entry_invoke_command()` and `entry_open_session()`. The commands `OPTEE_MSG_CMD_OPEN_SESSION` and `OPTEE_MSG_CMD_INVOKE_COMMAND` can be executed from the normal world via an OP-TEE SMC. This function is not validating the `num_params` argument which is only limited to `OPTEE_MSG_MAX_NUM_PARAMS` (127) in the function `get_cmd_buffer()`. Therefore an attacker in the normal world can craft an SMC call that will cause out-of-bounds reading in `cleanup_shm_refs` and potentially freeing of fake-objects in the function `mobj_put()`. A normal-world attacker with permission to execute SMC instructions may exploit this flaw.

CVE-2024-1931,NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1 contain a vulnerability that can cause denial of service by a certain code path that can lead to an infinite loop. Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client's advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition the code that trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered when the 'ede: yes' option is used; non default configuration. From version 1.19.2 on the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.,7.5,CWE-835

CVE-2025-21928,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in ishtp_hid_remove()  The system can experience a random crash a few minutes after the driver is removed. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory freeing in the ishtp_hid_remove() function.  The function currently frees the `driver_data` directly within the loop that destroys the HID devices which can lead to accessing freed memory. Specifically `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls `hid_ishtp_set_feature()` to power off the sensor so freeing `driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid memory.  This patch resolves the issue by storing the `driver_data` in a temporary variable before calling `hid_destroy_device()` and then freeing the `driver_data` after the device is destroyed.,7.8,CWE-416
