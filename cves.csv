CVE-2023-52895,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/poll: don't reissue in case of poll race on multishot request  A previous commit fixed a poll race that can occur but it's only applicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request we can safely ignore a spurious wakeup as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.  A blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a buffer if they are ring provided. While this seems like a bug in itself it's not really defined behavior to reissue a multishot request directly. It's less efficient to do so as well and not required to rearm anything like it is for singleshot poll requests.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2025-27092,GHOSTS is an open source user simulation framework for cyber experimentation simulation training and exercise. A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0 that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo retrieval endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint which is designed to serve profile photos for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) but fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths. When an NPC is created with a specially crafted photoLink value containing path traversal sequences (../ ..\ etc.) the application processes these sequences without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files outside of the intended photo directory potentially exposing sensitive system files. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process which could include configuration files credentials or other sensitive data. This issue has been addressed in version 8.2.7.90 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.5,CWE-22

CVE-2024-4435,When storing unbounded types in a BTreeMap a node is represented as a linked list of memory chunks. It was discovered recently that when we deallocate a node in some cases only the first memory chunk is deallocated and the rest of the memory chunks remain (incorrectly) allocated causing a memory leak. In the worst case depending on how a canister uses the BTreeMap an adversary could interact with the canister through its API and trigger interactions with the map that keep consuming memory due to the memory leak. This could potentially lead to using an excessive amount of memory or even running out of memory.  This issue has been fixed in  #212 https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/pull/212  by changing the logic for deallocating nodes to ensure that all of a node's memory chunks are deallocated and users are asked to upgrade to version 0.6.4.. Tests have been added to prevent regressions of this nature moving forward. Note: Users of stable-structure < 0.6.0 are not affected.  Users who are not storing unbounded types in BTreeMap are not affected and do not need to upgrade. Otherwise an upgrade to version 0.6.4 is necessary.,5.9,CWE-401

CVE-2023-2804,A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo in h2v2_merged_upsample_internal() function of jdmrgext.c file. The vulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for which the range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range hence an attacker could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting to decompress such image using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault or buffer overflows causing an application to crash.,6.5,CWE-122
CVE-2023-41331,SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. Versions prior to 5.11.0 are vulnerable to remote command execution. Through a carefully crafted payload an attacker can achieve JNDI injection or system command execution. In the default configuration of the SOFARPC framework a blacklist is used to filter out dangerous classes encountered during the deserialization process. However the blacklist is not comprehensive and an actor can exploit certain native JDK classes and common third-party packages to construct gadget chains capable of achieving JNDI injection or system command execution attacks. Version 5.11.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround users can add `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat` to the blacklist.,9.8,CWE-917

CVE-2023-52486,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm: Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock handling  If we get a deadlock after the fb lookup in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl() we proceed to unref the fb and then retry the whole thing from the top. But we forget to reset the fb pointer back to NULL and so if we then get another error during the retry before the fb lookup we proceed the unref the same fb again without having gotten another reference. The end result is that the fb will (eventually) end up being freed while it's still in use.  Reset fb to NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again until we've done another fb lookup.  This turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2 when doing async flips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The first symptom I saw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop while walking the framebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince it to oops instead and from there it was easier to track down the culprit.,5.5,CWE-667
