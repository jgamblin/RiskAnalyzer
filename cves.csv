CVE-2022-21657,Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions Envoy does not restrict the set of certificates it accepts from the peer either as a TLS client or a TLS server to only those certificates that contain the necessary extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth respectively). This means that a peer may present an e-mail certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection) either as a leaf certificate or as a CA in the chain and it will be accepted for TLS. This is particularly bad when combined with the issue described in pull request #630 in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for use with S/MIME and thus exempted from audit or supervision to issue TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.,6.8,CWE-295

CVE-2025-52565,runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2 due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133 except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)` so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however as with CVE-2025-31133 this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively).

CVE-2022-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()  On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space the ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs even though the CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the file the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to wake waiters as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.  While debugging this I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is OK to do) and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is not fine and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).

CVE-2024-26814,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/fsl-mc: Block calling interrupt handler without trigger  The eventfd_ctx trigger pointer of the vfio_fsl_mc_irq object is initially NULL and may become NULL if the user sets the trigger eventfd to -1.  The interrupt handler itself is guaranteed that trigger is always valid between request_irq() and free_irq() but the loopback testing mechanisms to invoke the handler function need to test the trigger.  The triggering and setting ioctl paths both make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.  The vfio-fsl-mc driver does not make use of irqfds nor does it support any sort of masking operations therefore unlike vfio-pci and vfio-platform the flow can remain essentially unchanged.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-1558,A path traversal vulnerability exists in the `_create_model_version()` function within `server/handlers.py` of the mlflow/mlflow repository due to improper validation of the `source` parameter. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a `source` parameter that bypasses the `_validate_non_local_source_contains_relative_paths(source)` function's checks allowing for arbitrary file read access on the server. The issue arises from the handling of unquoted URL characters and the subsequent misuse of the original `source` value for model version creation leading to the exposure of sensitive files when interacting with the `/model-versions/get-artifact` handler.,7.5,CWE-22

CVE-2024-55553,In FRRouting (FRR) before 10.3 from 6.0 onward all routes are re-validated if the total size of an update received via RTR exceeds the internal socket's buffer size default 4K on most OSes. An attacker can use this to trigger re-parsing of the RIB for FRR routers using RTR by causing more than this number of updates during an update interval (usually 30 minutes). Additionally this effect regularly occurs organically. Furthermore an attacker can use this to trigger route validation continuously. Given that routers with large full tables may need more than 30 minutes to fully re-validate the table continuous issuance/withdrawal of large numbers of ROA may be used to impact the route handling performance of all FRR instances using RPKI globally. Additionally the re-validation will cause heightened BMP traffic to ingestors. Fixed Versions: 10.0.3 10.1.2 10.2.1 >= 10.3.,7.5,CWE-404

While the default will stay at the setting that is described as potentially problematic in this reported issue a mitigation is available by changing the `terminate_connection_on_failed_response`  setting to `true`. However this cannot be set to this value by default since it can trigger errors in vehicle ECUs requiring ECU resets and lengthy unavailability in charging for vehicles. The maintainers judge this to be a much more important workaround then short-term unavailability of an EVSE therefore this setting will stay at the current value.,4.3,CWE-384

CVE-2024-28847,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. Similarly to the GHSL-2023-250 issue `AlertUtil::validateExpression` is also called from `EventSubscriptionRepository.prepare()` which can lead to Remote Code Execution. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which in turn gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`) it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and therefore after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method an attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/events/subscriptions` which gets handled by `EventSubscriptionResource.createOrUpdateEventSubscription()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-251`.,8.8,CWE-94
