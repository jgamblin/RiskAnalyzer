Users who used to be subscribed to a private stream and have been removed from it since retain the ability to edit messages/topics move messages to other streams and delete messages that they used to have access to if other relevant organization permissions allow these actions. For example a user may be able to edit or delete their old messages they posted in such a private stream. An administrator will be able to delete old messages (that they had access to) from the private stream. This issue was fixed in Zulip Server version 7.3.,6.5,CWE-285

CVE-2024-12797,Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated because handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode is set.  Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not detected by clients.  RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server and the server likewise enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.  Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result() and those that do and take appropriate action are not affected.  This issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.  The FIPS modules in 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.,6.3,CWE-392

CVE-2022-24765,Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git` which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\.git\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile e.g. `C:\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.,6.0,CWE-427

CVE-2025-27137,Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6 users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka Alert) and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself and highly discouraged.,4.4,CWE-73

CVE-2024-39565,An Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions ('XPath Injection') vulnerability in J-Web shipped with Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to execute remote commands on the target device.   While an administrator is logged into a J-Web session or has previously logged in and subsequently logged out of their J-Web session the attacker can arbitrarily execute commands on the target device with the other user's credentials. In the worst case the attacker will have full control over the device. This issue affects Junos OS:       *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8    *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S7   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S1 23.4R2.,8.8,CWE-643

CVE-2024-26659,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: handle isoc Babble and Buffer Overrun events properly  xHCI 4.9 explicitly forbids assuming that the xHC has released its ownership of a multi-TRB TD when it reports an error on one of the early TRBs. Yet the driver makes such assumption and releases the TD allowing the remaining TRBs to be freed or overwritten by new TDs.  The xHC should also report completion of the final TRB due to its IOC flag being set by us regardless of prior errors. This event cannot be recognized if the TD has already been freed earlier resulting in Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD error message.  Fix this by reusing the logic for processing isoc Transaction Errors. This also handles hosts which fail to report the final completion.  Fix transfer length reporting on Babble errors. They may be caused by device malfunction no guarantee that the buffer has been filled.,5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2023-35946,Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency cache it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates Gradle can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside the dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle process has write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will refuse to cache dependencies that have path traversal elements in their dependency coordinates. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2 `dependency verification` will make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit.,6.9,CWE-22
