CVE-2023-29020,@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: ['passport' 'session'])` to clear all the session attributes by default preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.,6.5,CWE-352
CVE-2023-2512,Prior to version v1.20230419.0 the FormData API implementation was subject to an integer overflow. If a FormData instance contained more than 2^31 elements the forEach() method could end up reading from the wrong location in memory while iterating over elements. This would most likely lead to a segmentation fault but could theoretically allow arbitrary undefined behavior.   In order for the bug to be exploitable the process would need to be able to allocate 160GB of RAM. Due to this the bug was never exploitable on the Cloudflare Workers platform but could theoretically be exploitable on deployments of workerd running on machines with a huge amount of memory. Moreover in order to be remotely exploited an attacker would have to upload a single form-encoded HTTP request of at least tens of gigabytes in size. The application code would then have to use request.formData() to parse the request and formData.forEach() to iterate over this data. Due to these limitations the exploitation likelihood was considered Low.  A fix that addresses this vulnerability has been released in version v1.20230419.0 and users are encouraged to update to the latest version available.   ,6.5,CWE-125

CVE-2024-26910,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation  The patch netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy and kernel side add/del/test commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition. But the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows it down: it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead.  Eric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as rcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors which need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy functions are split into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely at executing the command received by netlink and moving the remaining part only into the rcu callback.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2024-26729,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srv  Fixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in the dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() functions.  In both functions the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferenced before it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.  Thus moving the null checks for 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of the functions to ensure that 'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it is dereferenced.  Found by smatch & thus fixing the below: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c:133 dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'dc_dmub_srv' (see line 128) drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c:1167 dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'dc_dmub_srv' (see line 1164),5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-30844,Mutagen provides real-time file synchronization and flexible network forwarding for developers. Prior to versions 0.16.6 and 0.17.1 in `mutagen` and prior to version 0.17.1 in `mutagen-compose` Mutagen `list` and `monitor` commands are susceptible to control characters that could be provided by remote endpoints.  This could cause terminal corruption either intentional or unintentional if these characters were present in error messages or file paths/names. This could be used as an attack vector if synchronizing with an untrusted remote endpoint synchronizing files not under control of the user or forwarding to/from an untrusted remote endpoint.  On very old systems with terminals susceptible to issues such as CVE-2003-0069 the issue could theoretically cause code execution. The problem has been patched in Mutagen v0.16.6 and v0.17.1.  Earlier versions of Mutagen are no longer supported and will not be patched.  Versions of Mutagen after v0.18.0 will also have the patch merged.

CVE-2025-46820,phpgt/Dom provides access to modern DOM APIs. Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the GitHub API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository may be affected but the token should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run limiting the time during which exploitation could occur.

CVE-2024-52338,Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in the Apache Arrow R package versions 4.0.0 through 16.1.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it  reads Arrow IPC Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for  example user-supplied input files). This vulnerability only affects the arrow R package not other Apache Arrow  implementations or bindings unless those bindings are specifically used via the R package (for example an R application that embeds a Python interpreter and uses PyArrow to read files from untrusted sources is still vulnerable if the arrow R package is an affected version). It is recommended that users of the arrow R package upgrade to 17.0.0 or later. Similarly it  is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency  requirements to arrow 17.0.0 or later. If using an affected version of the package untrusted data can read into a Table and its internal to_data_frame() method can be used as a workaround (e.g. read_parquet(... as_data_frame = FALSE)$to_data_frame()).
