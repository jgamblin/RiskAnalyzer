CVE-2022-39249,Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end. Starting with version 19.7.0 the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately for example by showing a warning for such messages. This attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker and those who trust your homeservers do not need a workaround.,7.5,CWE-287

CVE-2024-21662,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13 2.9.9 and 2.10.4 an attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account. This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827 intended to protect against brute-force attacks. The application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for that account. This is a severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force attacks at an accelerated rate especially targeting the default admin account. Users should upgrade to version 2.8.13 2.9.9 or 2.10.4 to receive a patch.,7.5,CWE-307

CVE-2022-49419,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  video: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup  Commit b3c9a924aab6 (fbdev: vesafb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather than .remove) fixed a use-after-free error due the vesafb driver freeing the fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.  This can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove callback since the former tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.  But that change didn't take into account that another possible scenario is that .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback. For example if no process has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.  If that's the case fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is called making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that to no longer be valid.  To prevent that move the expression containing the info->par to happen before the unregister_framebuffer() function call.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-31021,Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. A weakness in the Hyperledger AnonCreds specification that is not mitigated in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations is that the Issuer does not publish a key correctness proof demonstrating that a generated private key is sufficient to meet the unlinkability guarantees of AnonCreds. The Ursa and AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations always generate a sufficient private key. A malicious issuer could in theory create a custom CL Signature implementation (derived from the Ursa or AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations) that uses weakened private keys such that presentations from holders could be shared by verifiers to the issuer who could determine the holder to which the credential was issued. This vulnerability could impact holders of AnonCreds credentials implemented using the CL-signature scheme in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations of CL Signatures.

CVE-2022-31034,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v0.11.0 are vulnerable to a variety of attacks when an SSO login is initiated from the Argo CD CLI or UI. The vulnerabilities are due to the use of insufficiently random values in parameters in Oauth2/OIDC login flows. In each case using a relatively-predictable (time-based) seed in a non-cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator made the parameter less random than required by the relevant spec or by general best practices. In some cases using too short a value made the entropy even less sufficient. The attacks on login flows which are meant to be mitigated by these parameters are difficult to accomplish but can have a high impact potentially granting an attacker admin access to Argo CD. Patches for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: v2.4.1 v2.3.5 v2.2.10 and v2.1.16. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.3,CWE-330
