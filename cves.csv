CVE-2023-49290,lestrrat-go/jwx is a Go module implementing various JWx (JWA/JWE/JWK/JWS/JWT otherwise known as JOSE) technologies. A p2c parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm PBES2-* could lead to a denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource- intensive. Therefore if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number it can cause a lot of computational consumption resulting in a denial of service. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has been included in release version 1.2.27 and 2.0.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.3,CWE-400

CVE-2024-39897,zot is an OCI image registry. Prior to 2.1.0 the cache driver `GetBlob()` allows read access to any blob without access control check. If a Zot `accessControl` policy allows users read access to some repositories but restricts read access to other repositories and `dedupe` is enabled (it is enabled by default) then an attacker who knows the name of an image and the digest of a blob (that they do not have read access to) they may maliciously read it via a second repository they do have read access to.   This attack is possible because [`ImageStore.CheckBlob()` calls `checkCacheBlob()`](https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/v2.1.0-rc2/pkg/storage/imagestore/imagestore.go#L1158-L1159) to find the blob a global cache by searching for the digest.

CVE-2023-52510,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ieee802154: ca8210: Fix a potential UAF in ca8210_probe  If of_clk_add_provider() fails in ca8210_register_ext_clock() it calls clk_unregister() to release priv->clk and returns an error. However the caller ca8210_probe() then calls ca8210_remove() where priv->clk is freed again in ca8210_unregister_ext_clock(). In this case a use-after-free may happen in the second time we call clk_unregister().  Fix this by removing the first clk_unregister().

CVE-2024-48985,An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets the software dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet data. A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet the size of which is calculated as the length of the packet body determined earlier and the header length. If the allocate fails because the specified packet is too large no exception handling occurs and hciTrSerialRxIncoming continues to write bytes into the 4-byte large temporary header buffer leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to the buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body but which couldn't be allocated. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which step of the parsing process is currently being executed. This advances the function to the next state where it proceeds to copy data to that arbitrary location. The packet body is then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.,7.5,CWE-120

CVE-2023-45133,Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse` using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any polyfill provider plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`.

CVE-2024-27287,ESPHome is a system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 for Home Automation systems. Starting in version 2023.12.9 and prior to version 2024.2.2 editing the configuration file API in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation and Home Assistant add-on) serves unsanitized data with `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8` allowing a remote authenticated user to inject arbitrary web script and exfiltrate session cookies via Cross-Site scripting. It is possible for a malicious authenticated user to inject arbitrary Javascript in configuration files using a POST request to the /edit endpoint the configuration parameter allows to specify the file to write. To trigger the XSS vulnerability the victim must visit the page` /edit?configuration=[xss file]`. Abusing this vulnerability a malicious actor could perform operations on the dashboard on the behalf of a logged user access sensitive information create edit and delete configuration files and flash firmware on managed boards.

CVE-2023-52498,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code  It is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core code deadlocks because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a requisite supplier device's one for example).  Address this by changing the code in question to use async_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly run them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.,5.5,CWE-667
