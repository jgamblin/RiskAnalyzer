CVE-2023-40021,Oppia is an online learning platform. When comparing a received CSRF token against the expected token Oppia uses the string equality operator (`==`) which is not safe against timing attacks. By repeatedly submitting invalid tokens an attacker can brute-force the expected CSRF token character by character. Once they have recovered the token they can then submit a forged request on behalf of a logged-in user and execute privileged actions on that user's behalf. In particular the function to validate received CSRF tokens is at `oppia.core.controllers.base.CsrfTokenManager.is_csrf_token_valid`. An attacker who can lure a logged-in Oppia user to a malicious website can perform any change on Oppia that the user is authorized to do including changing profile information; creating deleting and changing explorations; etc. Note that the attacker cannot change a user's login credentials. An attack would need to complete within 1 second because every second the time used in computing the token changes. This issue has been addressed in commit `b89bf80837` which has been included in release `3.3.2-hotfix-2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.3,CWE-203
