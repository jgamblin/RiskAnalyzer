CVE-2025-31161,CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used) as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025 aka Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access. A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/) the server will successfully find a username which triggers the successful anypass authentication process but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g. crushadmin) and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.,9.8,CWE-305

CVE-2022-49065,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: Fix the svc_deferred_event trace class  Fix a NULL deref crash that occurs when an svc_rqst is deferred while the sunrpc tracing subsystem is enabled. svc_revisit() sets dr->xprt to NULL so it can't be relied upon in the tracepoint to provide the remote's address.  Unfortunately we can't revert the svc_deferred_class hunk in commit ece200ddd54b (sunrpc: Save remote presentation address in svc_xprt for trace events) because there is now a specific check of event format specifiers for unsafe dereferences. The warning that check emits is:    event svc_defer_recv has unsafe dereference of argument 1  A %pISpc format specifier with a struct sockaddr * is indeed flagged by this check.  Instead take the brute-force approach used by the svcrdma_qp_error tracepoint. Convert the dr::addr field into a presentation address in the TP_fast_assign() arm of the trace event and store that as a string. This fix can be backported to -stable kernels.  In the meantime commit c6ced22997ad (tracing: Update print fmt check to handle new __get_sockaddr() macro) is now in v5.18 so this wonky fix can be replaced with __sockaddr() and friends properly during the v5.19 merge window.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-55603,Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`) to store the session data in a database. Therefore when a `session_id` is given kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point it does not correctly verify if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus a session which's lifetime is already `> time()` is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function that does remove invalid sessions is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()` based on `session.gc_divisor` `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1 session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-613

CVE-2024-25636,Misskey is an open source decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0 when fetching remote Activity Streams objects Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type.

CVE-2024-35895,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem  syzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes elements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be invoked from any interrupt context locks taken during a map_delete_elem operation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion is possible as reported by lockdep:         CPU0                    CPU1        ----                    ----   lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);                                local_irq_disable();                                lock(&host->lock);                                lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);   <Interrupt>     lock(&host->lock);  Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be deleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts enabled or in softirq context.  Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is _not_ hardirq-unsafe that is interrupts are disabled and bail out with an error.  Note that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does not allow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today.,5.5,CWE-667
