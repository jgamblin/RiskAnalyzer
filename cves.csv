CVE-2021-46928,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  parisc: Clear stale IIR value on instruction access rights trap  When a trap 7 (Instruction access rights) occurs this means the CPU couldn't execute an instruction due to missing execute permissions on the memory region.  In this case it seems the CPU didn't even fetched the instruction from memory and thus did not store it in the cr19 (IIR) register before calling the trap handler. So the trap handler will find some random old stale value in cr19.  This patch simply overwrites the stale IIR value with a constant magic bad food value (0xbaadf00d) in the hope people don't start to try to understand the various random IIR values in trap 7 dumps.,5.5,CWE-755

CVE-2024-45217,Insecure Default Initialization of Resource vulnerability in Apache Solr.  New ConfigSets that are created via a Restore command which copy a configSet from the backup and give it a new name are created without setting the trusted metadata.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6.0 before 8.11.4 from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0. This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured via Authentication/Authorization.

CVE-2023-44393,Piwigo is an open source photo gallery application. Prior to version 14.0.0beta4 a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is in the` /admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JS code into the HTML page which could then be executed by admin users when they visit the URL with the payload. The vulnerability is caused by the insecure injection of the `plugin_id` value from the URL into the HTML page. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains a specially crafted `plugin_id` value. When a victim who is logged in as an administrator visits this URL the malicious code will be injected into the HTML page and executed. This vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who has access to a malicious URL. However only users who are logged in as administrators are affected. This is because the vulnerability is only present on the `/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page which is only accessible to administrators. Version 14.0.0.beta4 contains a patch for this issue.,9.3,CWE-79

CVE-2024-25123,MSS (Mission Support System) is an open source package designed for planning atmospheric research flights. In file: `index.py` there is a method that is vulnerable to path manipulation attack. By modifying file paths an attacker can acquire sensitive information from different resources. The `filename` variable is joined with other variables to form a file path in `_file`. However `filename` is a route parameter that can capture path type values i.e. values including slashes (\). So it is possible for an attacker to manipulate the file being read by assigning a value containing ../ to `filename` and so the attacker may be able to gain access to other files on the host filesystem. This issue has been addressed in MSS version 8.3.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.3,CWE-22

CVE-2021-46969,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: mhi: core: Fix invalid error returning in mhi_queue  mhi_queue returns an error when the doorbell is not accessible in the current state. This can happen when the device is in non M0 state like M3 and needs to be waken-up prior ringing the DB. This case is managed earlier by triggering an asynchronous M3 exit via controller resume/suspend callbacks that in turn will cause M0 transition and DB update.  So since it's not an error but just delaying of doorbell update there is no reason to return an error.

CVE-2021-32846,HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this situation there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS` but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and under certain circumstance memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.,7.7,CWE-908

CVE-2024-4067,The NPM package `micromatch` prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything.

CVE-2025-25195,Zulip is an open source team chat application. A weekly cron job (added in 50256f48314250978f521ef439cafa704e056539) demotes channels to being inactive after they have not received traffic for 180 days.  However upon doing so an event was sent to all users in the organization not just users in the channel.  This event contained the name of the private channel. Similarly the same commit (50256f48314250978f521ef439cafa704e056539) added functionality to notify clients when channels stopped being inactive.  The first message sent to a private channel which had not previously had any messages for over 180 days (and were thus already marked inactive) would leak an event to all users in the organization; this event also contained the name of the private channel. Commits 75be449d456d29fef27e9d1828bafa30174284b4 and a2a1a7f8d152296c8966f1380872c0ac69e5c87e fixed the issue.
