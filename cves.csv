CVE-2024-26806,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooks  The ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are not expected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume(). Remove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.  Those helpers have two roles currently:  - They stop/start the queue including dealing with the kworker.  - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It    requires acquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex.  Step one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step two however has two implications:  - A deadlock occurs because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context    where the lock is already taken (in the ->exec_op() callback where    the usage count is incremented).  - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.  Here is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:  spi_mem_exec_op()         ...         spi_mem_access_start()                 mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)          cqspi_exec_mem_op()                 pm_runtime_resume_and_get()                         cqspi_resume()                                 spi_controller_resume()                                         mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)                 ...          spi_mem_access_end()                 mutex_unlock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)         ...,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-28114,`cilium-cli` is the command line interface to install manage and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters running Cilium. Prior to version 0.13.2`cilium-cli` when used to configure cluster mesh functionality can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote clusters. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected by this issue.  Due to an incorrect mount point specification the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that `etcd` cluster.  This issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2. As a workaround one may use Cilium's Helm charts to create their cluster.,4.8,CWE-280

CVE-2022-49410,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix potential double free in create_var_ref()  In create_var_ref() init_var_ref() is called to initialize the fields of variable ref_field which is allocated in the previous function call to create_hist_field(). Function init_var_ref() allocates the corresponding fields such as ref_field->system but frees these fields when the function encounters an error. The caller later calls destroy_hist_field() to conduct error handling which frees the fields and the variable itself. This results in double free of the fields which are already freed in the previous function.  Fix this by storing NULL to the corresponding fields when they are freed in init_var_ref().,7.8,CWE-415

CVE-2022-46156,The Synthetic Monitoring Agent for Grafana's Synthetic Monitoring application provides probe functionality and executes network checks for monitoring remote targets. Users running the Synthetic Monitoring agent prior to version 0.12.0 in their local network are impacted. The authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic Monitoring API is exposed through a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to retrieve the Synthetic Monitoring checks created by the user and assigned to the agent identified with that token. The Synthetic Monitoring API will reject connections from already-connected agents so access to the token does not guarantee access to the checks. Version 0.12.0 contains a fix. Users are advised to rotate the agent tokens. After upgrading to version v0.12.0 or later it's recommended that users of distribution packages review the configuration stored in `/etc/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-monitoring-agent.conf` specifically the `API_TOKEN` variable which has been renamed to `SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN`. As a workaround for previous versions it's recommended that users review the agent settings and set the HTTP listening address in a manner that limits the exposure for example localhost or a non-routed network by using the command line parameter `-listen-address` e.g. `-listen-address localhost:4050`.,7.2,CWE-489

CVE-2025-58063,CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.12.4 the CoreDNS etcd plugin contains a TTL confusion vulnerability where lease IDs are incorrectly used as TTL values enabling DNS cache pinning attacks. This effectively creates a DoS condition for DNS resolution of affected services. The `TTL()` function in `plugin/etcd/etcd.go` incorrectly casts etcd lease IDs (64-bit integers) to uint32 and uses them as TTL values. Large lease IDs become very large TTLs when cast to uint32. This enables cache pinning attacks. Version 1.12.4 contains a fix for the issue.,7.1,CWE-681

CVE-2023-28096,OpenSIPS a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation has a memory leak starting in the 2.3 branch and priot to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5. The memory leak was detected in the function `parse_mi_request` while performing coverage-guided fuzzing. This issue can be reproduced by sending multiple requests of the form `{jsonrpc: 2.0method: log_le`. This malformed message was tested against an instance of OpenSIPS via FIFO transport layer and was found to increase the memory consumption over time.  To abuse this memory leak attackers need to reach the management interface (MI) which typically should only be exposed on trusted interfaces. In cases where the MI is exposed to the internet without authentication abuse of this issue will lead to memory exhaustion which may affect the underlying system’s availability. No authentication is typically required to reproduce this issue. On the other hand memory leaks may occur in other areas of OpenSIPS where the cJSON library is used for parsing JSON objects.  The issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.,4.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-20499,Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a DoS condition in the AnyConnect service on an affected device.    These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of client-supplied parameters while establishing an SSL VPN session. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTPS request to the VPN server of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN connections and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate.

CVE-2025-58059,Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions before 12.16.0.RELEASE and from 13.0.0.RELEASE to before 13.1.2.RELEASE any admin that can create or modify and execute process-definitions could gain access to sensitive data or resources. This includes but is not limited to: running executables on the application host inspecting and extracting data from the host environment or application properties spring beans (application context database pooling). The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: the user must be logged in have the admin role and must have some knowledge about running scripts via a the Camunda/Operator engine. Version 12.16.0 and 13.1.2 have been patched. It is strongly advised to upgrade. If no scripting is needed in any of the processes it could be possible to disable it altogether via the ProcessEngineConfiguration. However this workaround could lead to unexpected side-effects.,9.1,CWE-78
CVE-2023-1186,A vulnerability has been found in FabulaTech Webcam for Remote Desktop 2.8.42 and classified as problematic.

CVE-2024-1681,corydolphin/flask-cors is vulnerable to log injection when the log level is set to debug. An attacker can inject fake log entries into the log file by sending a specially crafted GET request containing a CRLF sequence in the request path. This vulnerability allows attackers to corrupt log files potentially covering tracks of other attacks confusing log post-processing tools and forging log entries. The issue is due to improper output neutralization for logs.,5.3,CWE-117
CVE-2021-34931,This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Bentley View 10.15.0.75.
