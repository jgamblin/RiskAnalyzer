CVE-2024-26678,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section  The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from 32-bit firmware (i.e. CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)  This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the loader and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image to avoid the need for padding it to 4k which is required for sections appearing in the middle of the image.  Unfortunately this violates the PE/COFF spec and even if most EFI loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference implementation) PE loaders do exist that reject such images on the basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner without leaving any gaps.  So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slight padding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling CONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days),5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2024-56631,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: sg: Fix slab-use-after-free read in sg_release()  Fix a use-after-free bug in sg_release() detected by syzbot with KASAN:  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in lock_release+0x151/0xa30 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5838 __mutex_unlock_slowpath+0xe2/0x750 kernel/locking/mutex.c:912 sg_release+0x1f4/0x2e0 drivers/scsi/sg.c:407  In sg_release() the function kref_put(&sfp->f_ref sg_remove_sfp) is called before releasing the open_rel_lock mutex. The kref_put() call may decrement the reference count of sfp to zero triggering its cleanup through sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work via sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() which ultimately frees sfp.  After kref_put() sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may reference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed this results in a slab-use-after-free error.  Move the kref_put(&sfp->f_ref sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the open_rel_lock mutex. This ensures:   - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is    decremented.   - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and    sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the    mutex handling in sg_release().  The fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the bug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper sequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations eliminating the risk of use-after-free errors in sg_release().,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-35946,Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency cache it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates Gradle can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside the dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle process has write permissions.

CVE-2022-31127,NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com <a href=http://attacker.com>Before signing in claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com` and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4 as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest` you only need to upgrade. Otherwise make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it.,7.1,CWE-79
