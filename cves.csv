CVE-2023-40013,SVG Loader is a javascript library that fetches SVGs using XMLHttpRequests and injects the SVG code in the tag's place. According to the docs svg-loader will strip all JS code before injecting the SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not sufficient and can be trivially bypassed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious SVG which can result in Cross-site Scripting (XSS). When trying to sanitize the svg the lib removes event attributes such as `onmouseover` `onclick` but the list of events is not exhaustive.  Any website which uses external-svg-loader and allows its users to provide svg src upload svg files would be susceptible to stored XSS attack. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3562fc08` which is included in releases from 1.6.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.1,CWE-79

CVE-2022-48792,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task  Currently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upper layer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() or mpi_sata_completion().  In this case the following are the two steps in handling those I/O completions:   - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of    the I/O.   - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in    pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.  When complete() is called the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such we should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards but we do so in the pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.  Fix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-29198,TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0 2.8.1 2.7.2 and 2.6.4 the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorToCSRSparseMatrix` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code assumes `dense_shape` is a vector and `indices` is a matrix (as part of requirements for sparse tensors) but there is no validation for this. Versions 2.9.0 2.8.1 2.7.2 and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.,5.5,CWE-20
CVE-2024-47880,OpenRefine is a free open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3 the `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that it reflects part of the request verbatim with a Content-Type header also taken from the request. An attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains  embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response along with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header and so potentially executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do including deleting projects retrieving database passwords or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions if those extensions are also present. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue.,8.1,CWE-79

CVE-2024-23953,Use of Arrays.equals() in LlapSignerImpl in Apache Hive to compare message signatures allows attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. The attacker should be an authorized user of the product to perform this attack. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0 which fixes this issue.  The problem occurs when an application doesn’t use a constant-time algorithm for validating a signature. The method Arrays.equals() returns false right away when it sees that one of the input’s bytes are different. It means that the comparison time depends on the contents of the arrays. This little thing may allow an attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. So it might allow malicious users to submit splits/work with selected signatures to LLAP without running as a privileged user potentially leading to DDoS attack.
