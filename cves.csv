CVE-2024-24828,pkg is tool design to bundle Node.js projects into an executables. Any native code packages built by `pkg` are written to a hardcoded directory. On unix systems this is `/tmp/pkg/*` which is a shared directory for all users on the same local system. There is no uniqueness to the package names within this directory they are predictable. An attacker who has access to the same local system has the ability to replace the genuine executables in the shared directory with malicious executables of the same name. A user may then run the malicious executable without realising it has been modified. This package is deprecated. Therefore there will not be a patch provided for this vulnerability. To check if your executable build by pkg depends on native code and is vulnerable run the executable and check if `/tmp/pkg/` was created. Users should transition to actively maintained alternatives. We would recommend investigating Node.js 21’s support for single executable applications. Given the decision to deprecate the pkg package there are no official workarounds or remediations provided by our team. Users should prioritize migrating to other packages that offer similar functionality with enhanced security.,6.6,CWE-276

CVE-2023-44393,Piwigo is an open source photo gallery application. Prior to version 14.0.0beta4 a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is in the` /admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JS code into the HTML page which could then be executed by admin users when they visit the URL with the payload. The vulnerability is caused by the insecure injection of the `plugin_id` value from the URL into the HTML page. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains a specially crafted `plugin_id` value. When a victim who is logged in as an administrator visits this URL the malicious code will be injected into the HTML page and executed. This vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who has access to a malicious URL. However only users who are logged in as administrators are affected. This is because the vulnerability is only present on the `/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page which is only accessible to administrators. Version 14.0.0.beta4 contains a patch for this issue.,9.3,CWE-79

CVE-2024-46691,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: ucsi: Move unregister out of atomic section  Commit '9329933699b3 (soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Make client-lock non-sleeping)' moved the pmic_glink client list under a spinlock as it is accessed by the rpmsg/glink callback which in turn is invoked from IRQ context.  This means that ucsi_unregister() is now called from atomic context which isn't feasible as it's expecting a sleepable context. An effort is under way to get GLINK to invoke its callbacks in a sleepable context but until then lets schedule the unregistration.  A side effect of this is that ucsi_unregister() can now happen after the remote processor and thereby the communication link with it is gone. pmic_glink_send() is amended with a check to avoid the resulting NULL pointer dereference. This does however result in the user being informed about this error by the following entry in the kernel log:    ucsi_glink.pmic_glink_ucsi pmic_glink.ucsi.0: failed to send UCSI write request: -5,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-50273,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list  At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF we delete the ref from its ref head's ref_add_list using list_del() which leaves the ref's add_list member not reinitialized as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2 respectively.  If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref which can happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction abort we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call list_empty() against the ref's add_list which returns false since the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison pointers resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences otherwise.  So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.,5.5,CWE-908

CVE-2022-31078,KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1 1.10.2 and 1.9.4 the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1 1.10.2 and 1.9.4.

CVE-2024-27301,Support App is an opensource application specialized in managing Apple devices. It's possible to abuse a vulnerability inside the postinstall installer script to make the installer execute arbitrary code as root. The cause of the vulnerability is the fact that the shebang `#!/bin/zsh` is being used. When the installer is executed it asks for the users password to be executed as root. However it'll still be using the $HOME of the user and therefore loading the file  `$HOME/.zshenv` when the `postinstall` script is executed. An attacker could add malicious code to `$HOME/.zshenv` and it will be executed when the app is installed. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilege on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 2.5.1 Rev 2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.3,CWE-269

CVE-2022-31175,CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich text editor. A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting three optional CKEditor 5's packages in versions prior to 35.0.1. The vulnerability allowed to trigger a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions. The affected packages are `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm` `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support` and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-embed`. The specific conditions are 1) Using one of the affected packages.

CVE-2024-37155,OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9 the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace carriage return and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.,6.5,CWE-284
CVE-2024-11552,IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
