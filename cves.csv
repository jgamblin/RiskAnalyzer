CVE-2021-47243,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sch_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and header  The TCP option parser in cake qdisc (cake_get_tcpopt and cake_tcph_may_drop) could read one byte out of bounds. When the length is 1 the execution flow gets into the loop reads one byte of the opcode and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP it reads one more byte which exceeds the length of 1.  This fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 (ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack out of bounds when parsing TCP options.).  v2 changes:  Added doff validation in cake_get_tcphdr to avoid parsing garbage as TCP header. Although it wasn't strictly an out-of-bounds access (memory was allocated) garbage values could be read where CAKE expected the TCP header if doff was smaller than 5.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2022-43632,This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-1935 1.03 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SetQoSSettings requests to the web management portal. When parsing subelements within the QoSInfo element the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16153.,6.8,CWE-78
CVE-2024-55603,Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`) to store the session data in a database. Therefore when a `session_id` is given kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point it does not correctly verify if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus a session which's lifetime is already `> time()` is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function that does remove invalid sessions is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()` based on `session.gc_divisor` `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1 session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-613

CVE-2025-14505,The ECDSA implementation of the Elliptic package generates incorrect signatures if an interim value of 'k' (as computed based on step 3.2 of  RFC 6979 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979 ) has leading zeros and is susceptible to cryptanalysis which can lead to secret key exposure. This happens because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result. Furthermore due to the nature of the fault attackers could–under certain conditions–derive the secret key if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.  This issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).,5.6,CWE-1240

CVE-2024-24829,Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Sentry’s integration platform provides a way for external services to interact with Sentry. One of such integrations the Phabricator integration (maintained by Sentry) with version <=24.1.1 contains a constrained SSRF vulnerability. An attacker could make Sentry send POST HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs (including internal IP addresses) by providing an unsanitized input to the Phabricator integration.

CVE-2024-25619,Mastodon is a free open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. When an OAuth Application is destroyed the streaming server wasn't being informed that the Access Tokens had also been destroyed this could have posed security risks to users by allowing an application to continue listening to streaming after the application had been destroyed. Essentially this comes down to the fact that when Doorkeeper sets up the relationship between Applications and Access Tokens it uses a `dependent: delete_all` configuration which means the `after_commit` callback setup on `AccessTokenExtension` didn't actually fire since `delete_all` doesn't trigger ActiveRecord callbacks. To mitigate we need to add a `before_destroy` callback to `ApplicationExtension` which announces to streaming that all the Application's Access Tokens are being killed. Impact should be negligible given the affected application had to be owned by the user. None the less this issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6 4.1.14 4.0.14 and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability.,3.1,CWE-613

CVE-2022-42915,curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict gopher gophers ldap ldaps rtmp rtmps or telnet.

CVE-2025-21605,Redis is an open source in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3 An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server but no password is provided the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from NOAUTH responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls iptables security groups etc or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2022-50417,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panfrost: Fix GEM handle creation ref-counting  panfrost_gem_create_with_handle() previously returned a BO but with the only reference being from the handle which user space could in theory guess and release causing a use-after-free. Additionally if the call to panfrost_gem_mapping_get() in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo() failed then a(nother) reference on the BO was dropped.  The _create_with_handle() is a problematic pattern so ditch it and instead create the handle in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo().
