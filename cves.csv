CVE-2024-24823,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id even if for different user credentials. In this case the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an attack is high because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 and any versions of the 6.0 development branch contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists but is relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions` endpoint as that is the only one vulnerable.,5.7,CWE-384

CVE-2021-47243,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sch_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and header  The TCP option parser in cake qdisc (cake_get_tcpopt and cake_tcph_may_drop) could read one byte out of bounds. When the length is 1 the execution flow gets into the loop reads one byte of the opcode and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP it reads one more byte which exceeds the length of 1.  This fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 (ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack out of bounds when parsing TCP options.).  v2 changes:  Added doff validation in cake_get_tcphdr to avoid parsing garbage as TCP header.

CVE-2022-31078,KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1 1.10.2 and 1.9.4 the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1 1.10.2 and 1.9.4. As a workaround disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.,4.4,CWE-400

CVE-2022-29246,Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host device and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack. Prior to version 6.1.11 he USBX DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function does not assure that a buffer overflow will not occur during handling of the DFU UPLOAD command. When an attacker issues the `UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD` control transfer request with `wLenght` larger than the buffer size (`UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH` 256 bytes) depending on the actual implementation of `dfu -> ux_slave_class_dfu_read` a buffer overflow may occur. In example `ux_slave_class_dfu_read` may read 4096 bytes (or more up to 65k) to a 256 byte buffer ultimately resulting in an overflow. Furthermore in case an attacker has some control over the read flash memory this may result in execution of arbitrary code and platform compromise. A fix for this issue has been included in USBX release 6.1.11. As a workaround align request and buffer size to assure that buffer boundaries are respected.,9.8,CWE-120
