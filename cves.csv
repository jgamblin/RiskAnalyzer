CVE-2025-47935,Multer is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`. Versions prior to 2.0.0 are vulnerable to a resource exhaustion and memory leak issue due to improper stream handling.

This leads to unclosed streams accumulating over time consuming memory and file descriptors. Under sustained or repeated failure conditions this can result in denial of service requiring manual server restarts to recover. All users of Multer handling file uploads are potentially impacted. Users should upgrade to 2.0.0 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.,7.5,CWE-401

CVE-2022-29220,github-action-merge-dependabot is an action that automatically approves and merges dependabot pull requests (PRs). Prior to version 3.2.0 github-action-merge-dependabot does not check if a commit created by dependabot is verified with the proper GPG key. There is just a check if the actor is set to `dependabot[bot]` to determine if the PR is a legit PR. Theoretically an owner of a seemingly valid and legit action in the pipeline can check if the PR is created by dependabot and if their own action has enough permissions to modify the PR in the pipeline. If so they can modify the PR by adding a second seemingly valid and legit commit to the PR as they can set arbitrarily the username and email in for commits in git. Because the bot only checks if the actor is valid it would pass the malicious changes through and merge the PR automatically without getting noticed by project maintainers. It would probably not be possible to determine where the malicious commit came from as it would only say `dependabot[bot]` and the corresponding email-address. Version 3.2.0 contains a patch for this issue.,6.5,CWE-283

CVE-2024-43890,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()  tracing_map->next_elt in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.  Once it overflows new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map even though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached. Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the tracing_map containing tracing_map->max_size elements leaving no empty entries.

CVE-2024-31218,Webhood is a self-hosted URL scanner used analyzing phishing and malicious sites. Webhood's backend container images in versions 0.9.0 and earlier are subject to Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a HTTP request to the database (Pocketbase) admin API to create an admin account.

CVE-2024-27935,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3 a vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior. This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly. Version 1.36.3 contains a patch for this issue. ,7.2,CWE-488

CVE-2021-32732,### Impact It's possible to know if a user has or not an account in a wiki related to an email address and which username(s) is actually tied to that email by forging a request to the Forgot username page. Note that since this page does not have a CSRF check it's quite easy to perform a lot of those requests. ### Patches This issue has been patched in XWiki 12.10.5 and 13.2RC1. Two different patches are provided: - a first one to fix the CSRF problem - a more complex one that now relies on sending an email for the Forgot username process. ### Workarounds It's possible to fix the problem without uprading by editing the ForgotUsername page in version below 13.x to use the following code: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/69548c0320cbd772540cf4668743e69f879812cf/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-administration/xwiki-platform-administration-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/ForgotUsername.xml#L39-L123 In version after 13.x it's also possible to edit manually the forgotusername.vm file but it's really encouraged to upgrade the version here. ### References * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18384 * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18408 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org) * Email us at [security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org),7.5,CWE-352
