CVE-2024-0607,A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration 8 bytes are written but `dst` is an array of u32 so each element only has space for 4 bytes.

CVE-2023-33187,Highlight is an open source full-stack monitoring platform. Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type=text` via a javascript Show Password button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=password` inputs. A customer may assume that switching to `type=text` would also not record this input; hence they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show Password` button is used. This issue was patched in version 6.0.0. This patch tracks changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a `type=password` continues to be obfuscated.  ,5.4,CWE-319
CVE-2024-41127,Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access.

CVE-2024-34346,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. The Deno sandbox may be unexpectedly weakened by allowing file read/write access to privileged files in various locations on Unix and Windows platforms. For example reading `/proc/self/environ` may provide access equivalent to `--allow-env` and writing `/proc/self/mem` may provide access equivalent to `--allow-all`. Users who grant read and write access to the entire filesystem may not realize that these access to these files may have additional unintended consequences. The documentation did not reflect that this practice should be undertaken to increase the strength of the security sandbox. Users who run code with `--allow-read` or `--allow-write` may unexpectedly end up granting additional permissions via file-system operations. Deno 1.43 and above require explicit `--allow-all` access to read or write `/etc` `/dev` on unix platform (as well as `/proc` and `/sys` on linux platforms) and any path starting with `\\` on Windows. ,8.4,CWE-863

CVE-2022-29162,runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.,5.9,CWE-276

CVE-2024-56326,Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5 An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.,7.8,CWE-693

CVE-2022-39354,SputnikVM also called evm is a Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. A custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine if the call is executed in a static context (via `STATICCALL`) and thus decide if stateful operations should be done.
