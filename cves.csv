CVE-2024-43890,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()  tracing_map->next_elt in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.  Once it overflows new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map even though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached. Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the tracing_map containing tracing_map->max_size elements leaving no empty entries. If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using `__tracing_map_insert()` it will cause an infinite loop with preemption disabled leading to a CPU hang problem.  Fix this by preventing any further increments to tracing_map->next_elt once it reaches tracing_map->max_elt.,5.5,CWE-190
CVE-2022-41903,Git is distributed revision control system. `git log` can display commits in an arbitrary format using its `--format` specifiers. This functionality is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute. When processing the padding operators there is a integer overflow in `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly as an `int` and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g. `git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17 going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable `git archive` in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive via `git daemon` disable it by running `git config --global daemon.uploadArch false`.,9.8,CWE-190
CVE-2024-53859,go-gh is a Go module for interacting with the `gh` utility and the GitHub API from the command line. A security vulnerability has been identified in `go-gh` that could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace. `go-gh` sources authentication tokens from different environment variables depending on the host involved: 1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub.com and ghe.com and 2. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` for GitHub Enterprise Server. Prior to version `2.11.1` `auth.TokenForHost` could source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for a host other than GitHub.com or ghe.com when within a codespace. In version `2.11.1` `auth.TokenForHost` will only source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub.com or ghe.com hosts. Successful exploitation could send authentication token to an unintended host. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users are also advised to regenerate authentication tokens and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise.,6.5,CWE-200

CVE-2022-29224,Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. Versions of envoy prior to 1.22.1 are subject to a segmentation fault in the GrpcHealthCheckerImpl. Envoy can perform various types of upstream health checking. One of them uses gRPC. Envoy also has a feature which can “hold” (prevent removal) upstream hosts obtained via service discovery until configured active health checking fails. If an attacker controls an upstream host and also controls service discovery of that host (via DNS the EDS API etc.) an attacker can crash Envoy by forcing removal of the host from service discovery and then failing the gRPC health check request. This will crash Envoy via a null pointer dereference. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may disable gRPC health checking and/or replace it with a different health checking type as a mitigation.,5.9,CWE-476

CVE-2022-23506,Spinnaker is an open source multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes and Spinnaker's Rosco microservice produces machine images. Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2 1.28.4 and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds.  This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2 1.28.4 and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue.  A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.,4.3,CWE-532

CVE-2023-34285,NETGEAR RAX30 cmsCli_authenticate Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR RAX30 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within a shared library used by the telnetd service which listens on TCP port 23 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19918.,8.8,CWE-121
CVE-2022-2431,The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in versions up to and including 3.2.50. This is due to insufficient file type and path validation on the deleteFiles() function found in the ~/Admin/Menu/Packages.php file that triggers upon download post deletion. This makes it possible for contributor level users and above to supply an arbitrary file path via the 'file[files]' parameter when creating a download post and once the user deletes the post the supplied arbitrary file will be deleted. This can be used by attackers to delete the /wp-config.php file which will reset the installation and make it possible for an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server.,8.1,CWE-73
CVE-2024-46859,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86: panasonic-laptop: Fix SINF array out of bounds accesses  The panasonic laptop code in various places uses the SINF array with index values of 0 - SINF_CUR_BRIGHT(0x0d) without checking that the SINF array is big enough.  Not all panasonic laptops have this many SINF array entries for example the Toughbook CF-18 model only has 10 SINF array entries. So it only supports the AC+DC brightness entries and mute.  Check that the SINF array has a minimum size which covers all AC+DC brightness entries and refuse to load if the SINF array is smaller.  For higher SINF indexes hide the sysfs attributes when the SINF array does not contain an entry for that attribute avoiding show()/store() accessing the array out of bounds and add bounds checking to the probe() and resume() code accessing these.,7.8,CWE-129
