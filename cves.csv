CVE-2024-55603,Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`) to store the session data in a database. Therefore when a `session_id` is given kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point it does not correctly verify if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus a session which's lifetime is already `> time()` is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function that does remove invalid sessions is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()` based on `session.gc_divisor` `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1 session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-613

CVE-2024-34715,Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. The Fides webserver requires a connection to a hosted PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of application data. If the password used by the webserver for this database connection includes special characters such as `@` and `$` webserver startup fails and the part of the password following the special character is exposed in webserver error logs.

CVE-2023-46129,NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology built for the cloud on-premise IoT and edge computing. The cryptographic key handling library nkeys recently gained support for encryption not just for signing/authentication. This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys versions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5 corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3 the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handling logic mistakenly passed an array by value into an internal function where the function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. As a result all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects encryption only not signing.   FIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTH CALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys Go library 0.4.6 corresponding with NATS Server 2.10.4 has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. For any application handling auth callouts in Go if using the nkeys library update the dependency recompile and deploy that in lockstep.,7.5,CWE-321

CVE-2024-35847,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v3-its: Prevent double free on error  The error handling path in its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() causes a double free when its_vpe_init() fails after successfully allocating at least one interrupt. This happens because its_vpe_irq_domain_free() frees the interrupts along with the area bitmap and the vprop_page and its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() subsequently frees the area bitmap and the vprop_page again.  Fix this by unconditionally invoking its_vpe_irq_domain_free() which handles all cases correctly and by removing the bitmap/vprop_page freeing from its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc().
