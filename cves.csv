CVE-2024-53090,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  afs: Fix lock recursion  afs_wake_up_async_call() can incur lock recursion.  The problem is that it is called from AF_RXRPC whilst holding the ->notify_lock but it tries to take a ref on the afs_call struct in order to pass it to a work queue - but if the afs_call is already queued we then have an extraneous ref that must be put... calling afs_put_call() may call back down into AF_RXRPC through rxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call() however which might try taking the ->notify_lock again.  This case isn't very common however so defer it to a workqueue.  The oops looks something like:    BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0 krxrpcio/7001/1646    lock: 0xffff888141399b30 .magic: dead4ead .owner: krxrpcio/7001/1646 .owner_cpu: 0   CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 1646 Comm: krxrpcio/7001 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc2-build3+ #4351   Hardware name: ASUS All Series/H97-PLUS BIOS 2306 10/09/2014   Call Trace:    <TASK>    dump_stack_lvl+0x47/0x70    do_raw_spin_lock+0x3c/0x90    rxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call+0x83/0xb0    afs_put_call+0xd7/0x180    rxrpc_notify_socket+0xa0/0x190    rxrpc_input_split_jumbo+0x198/0x1d0    rxrpc_input_data+0x14b/0x1e0    ? rxrpc_input_call_packet+0xc2/0x1f0    rxrpc_input_call_event+0xad/0x6b0    rxrpc_input_packet_on_conn+0x1e1/0x210    rxrpc_input_packet+0x3f2/0x4d0    rxrpc_io_thread+0x243/0x410    ? __pfx_rxrpc_io_thread+0x10/0x10    kthread+0xcf/0xe0    ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10    ret_from_fork+0x24/0x40    ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10    ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30    </TASK>,5.5,CWE-674

CVE-2022-48975,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: fix memory leak in gpiochip_setup_dev()  Here is a backtrace report about memory leak detected in gpiochip_setup_dev():  unreferenced object 0xffff88810b406400 (size 512):   comm python3 pid 1682 jiffies 4295346908 (age 24.090s)   backtrace:     kmalloc_trace     device_add		device_private_init at drivers/base/core.c:3361 			(inlined by) device_add at drivers/base/core.c:3411     cdev_device_add     gpiolib_cdev_register     gpiochip_setup_dev     gpiochip_add_data_with_key  gcdev_register() & gcdev_unregister() would call device_add() & device_del() (no matter CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is enabled or not) to register/unregister device.  However if device_add() succeeds some resource (like struct device_private allocated by device_private_init()) is not released by device_del().  Therefore after device_add() succeeds by gcdev_register() it needs to call put_device() to release resource in the error handle path.  Here we move forward the register of release function and let it release every piece of resource by put_device() instead of kfree().  While at it fix another subtle issue i.e. when gc->ngpio is equal to 0 we still call kcalloc() and in case of further error kfree() on the ZERO_PTR pointer which is not NULL. It's not a bug per se but rather waste of the resources and potentially wrong expectation about contents of the gdev->descs variable.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-36422,Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 1.4.3 of Flowise a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs in the `api/v1/chatflows/id` endpoint. If the default configuration is used (unauthenticated) an attacker may be able to craft a specially crafted URL that injects Javascript into the user sessions allowing the attacker to steal information create false popups or even redirect the user to other websites without interaction. If the chatflow ID is not found its value is reflected in the 404 page which has type text/html. This allows an attacker to attach arbitrary scripts to the page allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information. This XSS may be chained with the path injection to allow an attacker without direct access to Flowise to read arbitrary files from the Flowise server. As of time of publication no known patches are available.,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2023-22464,ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories. Versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.1.30 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that when embedded into an HTML stream would cause the browser to run unwanted code) which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.3 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.30 (if they are using a 1.1.x version).  ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported so users of that release lineage should implement one of the following workarounds. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed path copyfrom paths during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths and wrap them with `[format html]` and `[end]`.  For most users that means that references to `[changes.copy_path]` will become `[format html][changes.copy_path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC else copyfrom path names will be doubly escaped.) ,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2024-42240,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation  When BHI mitigation is enabled if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set then entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the clear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler (exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the entry_SYSENTER_compat() function.  To address this issue entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY after making sure the TF flag is cleared.  The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:    $ cat sysenter_step.c   int main()   { asm(pushf; pop %ax; bts $8%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter); }    $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c    $ ./sysenter_step   Segmentation fault (core dumped)  The program is expected to crash and the #DB handler will issue a warning.

CVE-2024-43804,Roxy-WI is a web interface for managing Haproxy Nginx Apache and Keepalived servers. An OS Command Injection vulnerability allows any authenticated user on the application to execute arbitrary code on the web application server via port scanning functionality. User-supplied input is used without validation when constructing and executing an OS command. User supplied JSON POST data is parsed and if id JSON key does not exist JSON value supplied via ip JSON key is assigned to the ip variable. Later on ip variable which can be controlled by the attacker is used when constructing the cmd and cmd1 strings without any extra validation. Then server_mod.subprocess_execute function is called on both cmd1 and cmd2. When the definition of the server_mod.subprocess_execute() function is analyzed it can be seen that subprocess.Popen() is called on the input parameter with shell=True which results in OS Command Injection. This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to contact the Roxy-WI to coordinate a fix.,8.8,CWE-78

CVE-2022-20846,A vulnerability in the Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause the Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol process to reload on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to a heap buffer overflow in certain Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol messages.

CVE-2024-25618,Mastodon is a free open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured authentication providers (CAS SAML OIDC) to attach to existing local users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave. However some well-known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover OpenID Connect also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6 4.1.14 4.0.14 and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.2,CWE-287
