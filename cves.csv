The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry but the hash functions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist array.  rehash does:   rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst ndst) [..]   net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask;  While state lookup does:   h = xfrm_dst_hash(net daddr saddr tmpl->reqid encap_family);   hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x net->xfrm.state_bydst + h bydst) {  This is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than net->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets serialized via state spinlock again).  Fix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers. The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer and the hmask will be consistent.  The existing helpers like xfrm_dst_hash() are now unsafe for RCU side add lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for insert side.  xfrm_state_lookup_byaddr() uses the spinlock rather than RCU. AFAICS this is an oversight from back when state lookup was converted to RCU this lock should be replaced with RCU in a future patch.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2024-23331,Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. The Vite dev server option `server.fs.deny` can be bypassed on case-insensitive file systems using case-augmented versions of filenames. Notably this affects servers hosted on Windows. This bypass is similar to CVE-2023-34092 -- with surface area reduced to hosts having case-insensitive filesystems. Since `picomatch` defaults to case-sensitive glob matching but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist bypass is possible. By requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented casing the matcher derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to block access to sensitive files. This issue has been addressed in vite@5.0.12 vite@4.5.2 vite@3.2.8 and vite@2.9.17. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to dev servers.,7.5,CWE-178

CVE-2024-26912,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/nouveau: fix several DMA buffer leaks  Nouveau manages GSP-RM DMA buffers with nvkm_gsp_mem objects.  Several of these buffers are never dealloced.  Some of them can be deallocated right after GSP-RM is initialized but the rest need to stay until the driver unloads.  Also futher bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer and clearing the nvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated.  Poisoning the buffer should trigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it tries to access the buffer after we've deallocated it because we were wrong about when it is safe to deallocate.

However the offending commit started to use function get_cqe() for getting the CQEs the issue with this change is that get_cqe() always returns CQEs from cq->buf which leads us to initialize the wrong buffer and in case of enlarging the CQ we try to access elements beyond the size of the current cq->buf and eventually hit a kernel panic.

CVE-2024-47678,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  icmp: change the order of rate limits  ICMP messages are ratelimited :  After the blamed commits the two rate limiters are applied in this order:  1) host wide ratelimit (icmp_global_allow())  2) Per destination ratelimit (inetpeer based)  In order to avoid side-channels attacks we need to apply the per destination check first.  This patch makes the following change :  1) icmp_global_allow() checks if the host wide limit is reached.    But credits are not yet consumed. This is deferred to 3)  2) The per destination limit is checked/updated.    This might add a new node in inetpeer tree.  3) icmp_global_consume() consumes tokens if prior operations succeeded.  This means that host wide ratelimit is still effective in keeping inetpeer tree small even under DDOS.  As a bonus I removed icmp_global.lock as the fast path can use a lock-free operation.,5.5,CWE-203

CVE-2024-47748,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost_vdpa: assign irq bypass producer token correctly  We used to call irq_bypass_unregister_producer() in vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which is problematic as we don't know if the token pointer is still valid or not.  Actually we use the eventfd_ctx as the token so the life cycle of the token should be bound to the VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL instead of vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which could be called by set_status().  Fixing this by setting up irq bypass producer's token when handling VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL and un-registering the producer before calling vhost_vring_ioctl() to prevent a possible use after free as eventfd could have been released in vhost_vring_ioctl(). And such registering and unregistering will only be done if DRIVER_OK is set.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-26678,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section  The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from 32-bit firmware (i.e. CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)  This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the loader and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image to avoid the need for padding it to 4k which is required for sections appearing in the middle of the image.  Unfortunately this violates the PE/COFF spec and even if most EFI loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference implementation) PE loaders do exist that reject such images on the basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner without leaving any gaps.  So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slight padding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling CONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days),5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2023-26044,react/http is an event-driven streaming HTTP client and server implementation for ReactPHP.  Previous versions of ReactPHP's HTTP server component contain a potential DoS vulnerability that can cause high CPU load when processing large HTTP request bodies. This vulnerability has little to no impact on the default configuration but can be exploited when explicitly using the RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with very large settings. This might lead to consuming large amounts of CPU time for processing requests and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate user requests. This issue has been addressed in release 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may keep the request body limited using RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with a sensible value which should mitigate the issue. An infrastructure or DevOps workaround could be to place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any excessive HTTP request bodies. ,5.3,CWE-400
