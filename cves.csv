CVE-2023-25163,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v2.6.0-rc1 have an output sanitization bug which leaks repository access credentials in error messages. These error messages are visible to the user and they are logged. The error message is visible when a user attempts to create or update an Application via the Argo CD API (and therefor the UI or CLI). The user must have `applications create` or `applications update` RBAC access to reach the code which may produce the error. The user is not guaranteed to be able to trigger the error message. They may attempt to spam the API with requests to trigger a rate limit error from the upstream repository. If the user has `repositories update` access they may edit an existing repository to introduce a URL typo or otherwise force an error message. But if they have that level of access they are probably intended to have access to the credentials anyway. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.3,CWE-532

CVE-2025-64186,Evervault is a payment security solution. A vulnerability was identified in the `evervault-go` SDK’s attestation verification logic in versions of `evervault-go` prior to 1.3.2 that may allow incomplete documents to pass validation. This may cause the client to trust an enclave operator that does not meet expected integrity guarantees. The exploitability of this issue is limited in Evervault-hosted environments as an attacker would require the pre-requisite ability to serve requests from specific evervault domain names following from our ACME challenge based TLS certificate acquisition pipeline. The vulnerability primarily affects applications which only check PCR8. Though the efficacy is also reduced for applications that check all PCR values the impact is largely remediated by checking PCR 0 1 and 2. The identified issue has been addressed in version 1.3.2 by validating attestation documents before storing in the cache and replacing the naive equality checks with a new SatisfiedBy check. Those who useevervault-go to attest Enclaves that are hosted outside of Evervault environments and cannot upgrade have two possible workarounds available. Modify the application logic to fail verification if PCR8 is not explicitly present and non-empty and/or add custom pre-validation to reject documents that omit any required PCRs.,8.7,CWE-347

CVE-2023-41046,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible in XWiki to execute Velocity code without having script right by creating an XClass with a property of type TextArea and content type VelocityCode or VelocityWiki. For the former the syntax of the document needs to be set the `xwiki/1.0` (this syntax doesn't need to be installed). In both cases when adding the property to an object the Velocity code is executed regardless of the rights of the author of the property (edit right is still required though). In both cases the code is executed with the correct context author so no privileged APIs can be accessed. However Velocity still grants access to otherwise inaccessible data and APIs that could allow further privilege escalation. At least for VelocityCode this behavior is most likely very old but only since XWiki 7.2 script right is a separate right before that version all users were allowed to execute Velocity and thus this was expected and not a security issue. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.10 and 15.4 RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.,6.3,CWE-862

CVE-2024-39315,Pomerium is an identity and context-aware access proxy. Prior to version 0.26.1 the Pomerium user info page (at `/.pomerium`) unintentionally included serialized OAuth2 access and ID tokens from the logged-in user's session. These tokens are not intended to be exposed to end users. This issue may be more severe in the presence of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in an upstream application proxied through Pomerium. If an attacker could insert a malicious script onto a web page proxied through Pomerium that script could access these tokens by making a request to the `/.pomerium` endpoint. Upstream applications that authenticate only the ID token may be vulnerable to user impersonation using a token obtained in this manner. Note that an OAuth2 access token or ID token by itself is not sufficient to hijack a user's Pomerium session. Upstream applications should not be vulnerable to user impersonation via these tokens provided the application verifies the Pomerium JWT for each request the connection between Pomerium and the application is secured by mTLS or the connection between Pomerium and the application is otherwise secured at the network layer. The issue is patched in Pomerium v0.26.1. No known workarounds are available.,5.7,CWE-201

CVE-2025-47950,CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. In versions prior to 1.12.2 a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams` which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size` which Introduces a server-wide bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in the Corefile use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies.,7.5,CWE-770
CVE-2023-52627,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events  AD7091R-5 devices are supported by the ad7091r-5 driver together with the ad7091r-base driver. Those drivers declared iio events for notifying user space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limit registers or above the values set in high limit registers. However to configure iio events and their thresholds a set of callback functions must be implemented and those were not present until now. The consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without the proper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernel because the pointers to the callback functions were not set.  Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/write event thresholds and enable/disable event generation.  Since the event spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices also move those from the ad7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reused when support for ad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-52473,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal: core: Fix NULL pointer dereference in zone registration error path  If device_register() in thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips() returns an error the tz variable is set to NULL and subsequently dereferenced in kfree(tz->tzp).  Commit adc8749b150c (thermal/drivers/core: Use put_device() if device_register() fails) added the tz = NULL assignment in question to avoid a possible double-free after dropping the reference to the zone device.  However after commit 4649620d9404 (thermal: core: Make thermal_zone_device_unregister() return after freeing the zone) that assignment has become redundant because dropping the reference to the zone device does not cause the zone object to be freed any more.  Drop it to address the NULL pointer dereference.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-27933,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. In version 1.39.0 use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()` which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource the raw file descriptor is closed together.  Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.  This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed suppressing all prompt outputs.  Version 1.39.1 fixes the bug. ,8.2,CWE-863
