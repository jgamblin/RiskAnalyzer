CVE-2024-43805,jupyterlab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing based on the Jupyter Notebook Architecture. This vulnerability depends on user interaction by opening a malicious notebook with Markdown cells or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature. A malicious user can access any data that the attacked user has access to as well as perform arbitrary requests acting as the attacked user.

CVE-2025-21857,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: cls_api: fix error handling causing NULL dereference  tcf_exts_miss_cookie_base_alloc() calls xa_alloc_cyclic() which can return 1 if the allocation succeeded after wrapping. This was treated as an error with value 1 returned to caller tcf_exts_init_ex() which sets exts->actions to NULL and returns 1 to caller fl_change().  fl_change() treats err == 1 as success calling tcf_exts_validate_ex() which calls tcf_action_init() with exts->actions as argument where it is dereferenced.

CVE-2024-39506,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  liquidio: Adjust a NULL pointer handling path in lio_vf_rep_copy_packet  In lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() pg_info->page is compared to a NULL value but then it is unconditionally passed to skb_add_rx_frag() which looks strange and could lead to null pointer dereference.  lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() call trace looks like: 	octeon_droq_process_packets 	 octeon_droq_fast_process_packets 	  octeon_droq_dispatch_pkt 	   octeon_create_recv_info 	    ...search in the dispatch_list... 	     ->disp_fn(rdisp->rinfo ...) 	      lio_vf_rep_pkt_recv(struct octeon_recv_info *recv_info ...) In this path there is no code which sets pg_info->page to NULL. So this check looks unneeded and doesn't solve potential problem. But I guess the author had reason to add a check and I have no such card and can't do real test. In addition the code in the function liquidio_push_packet() in liquidio/lio_core.c does exactly the same.  Based on this I consider the most acceptable compromise solution to adjust this issue by moving skb_add_rx_frag() into conditional scope.

CVE-2023-39950,efibootguard is a simple UEFI boot loader with support for safely switching between current and updated partition sets. Insufficient or missing validation and sanitization of input from untrustworthy bootloader environment files can cause crashes and probably also code injections into `bg_setenv`) or programs using `libebgenv`. This is triggered when the affected components try to modify a manipulated environment in particular its user variables. Furthermore `bg_printenv` may crash over invalid read accesses or report invalid results. Not affected by this issue is EFI Boot Guard's bootloader EFI binary.

CVE-2024-41799,tgstation-server is a production scale tool for BYOND server management. Prior to 6.8.0 low permission users using the Set .dme Path privilege could potentially set malicious .dme files existing on the host machine to be compiled and executed. These .dme files could be uploaded via tgstation-server (requiring a separate isolated privilege) or some other means. A server configured to execute in BYOND's trusted security level (requiring a third separate isolated privilege OR being set by another user) could lead to this escalating into remote code execution via BYOND's shell() proc. The ability to execute this kind of attack is a known side effect of having privileged TGS users but normally requires multiple privileges with known weaknesses.

CVE-2021-46966,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: custom_method: fix potential use-after-free issue  In cm_write() buf is always freed when reaching the end of the function.  If the requested count is less than table.length the allocated buffer will be freed but subsequent calls to cm_write() will still try to access it.

CVE-2025-22060,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mvpp2: Prevent parser TCAM memory corruption  Protect the parser TCAM/SRAM memory and the cached (shadow) SRAM information from concurrent modifications.  Both the TCAM and SRAM tables are indirectly accessed by configuring an index register that selects the row to read or write to. This means that operations must be atomic in order to e.g. avoid spreading writes across multiple rows. Since the shadow SRAM array is used to find free rows in the hardware table it must also be protected in order to avoid TOCTOU errors where multiple cores allocate the same row.  This issue was detected in a situation where `mvpp2_set_rx_mode()` ran concurrently on two CPUs. In this particular case the MVPP2_PE_MAC_UC_PROMISCUOUS entry was corrupted causing the classifier unit to drop all incoming unicast - indicated by the `rx_classifier_drops` counter.,4.7,CWE-367
