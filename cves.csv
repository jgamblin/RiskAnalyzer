CVE-2024-26242,Windows Telephony Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability,7.0,CWE-591
CVE-2025-5054,Race condition in Canonical apport up to and including 2.32.0 allows a local attacker to leak sensitive information via PID-reuse by leveraging namespaces.     When handling a crash the function `_check_global_pid_and_forward` which detects if the crashing process resided in a container was being called before `consistency_checks` which attempts to detect if the crashing process had been replaced. Because of this if a process crashed and was quickly replaced with a containerized one apport could be made to forward the core dump to the container potentially leaking sensitive information. `consistency_checks` is now being called before `_check_global_pid_and_forward`. Additionally given that the PID-reuse race condition cannot be reliably detected from userspace alone crashes are only forwarded to containers if the kernel provided a pidfd or if the crashing process was unprivileged (i.e. if dump mode == 1).,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2022-35949,undici is an HTTP/1.1 client written from scratch for Node.js.`undici` is vulnerable to SSRF (Server-side Request Forgery) when an application takes in **user input** into the `path/pathname` option of `undici.request`. If a user specifies a URL such as `http://127.0.0.1` or `//127.0.0.1` ```js const undici = require(undici) undici.request({origin: http://example.com pathname: //127.0.0.1}) ``` Instead of processing the request as `http://example.org//127.0.0.1` (or `http://example.org/http://127.0.0.1` when `http://127.0.0.1 is used`) it actually processes the request as `http://127.0.0.1/` and sends it to `http://127.0.0.1`. If a developer passes in user input into `path` parameter of `undici.request` it can result in an _SSRF_ as they will assume that the hostname cannot change when in actual fact it can change because the specified path parameter is combined with the base URL. This issue was fixed in `undici@5.8.1`. The best workaround is to validate user input before passing it to the `undici.request` call.,5.3,CWE-918

This could allow a malicious unprivileged user inside the guest to gain access to resources accessible to the root group potentially escalating their privileges within the guest. A malicious local user in the host might also leverage this unexpected executable file created by the guest to escalate their privileges on the host system.,7.8,CWE-273

CVE-2024-56695,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'  The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable which could lead to stack overflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc` thereby reducing the stack size.  This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space  in scenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is freed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory leaks.  Fixes the below with gcc W=1: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function ‘kfd_get_cu_occupancy’: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]   322 | }       | ^,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2023-40176,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can exploit a stored XSS through their user profile by setting the payload as the value of the time zone user preference.

CVE-2024-41799,tgstation-server is a production scale tool for BYOND server management. Prior to 6.8.0 low permission users using the Set .dme Path privilege could potentially set malicious .dme files existing on the host machine to be compiled and executed. These .dme files could be uploaded via tgstation-server (requiring a separate isolated privilege) or some other means. A server configured to execute in BYOND's trusted security level (requiring a third separate isolated privilege OR being set by another user) could lead to this escalating into remote code execution via BYOND's shell() proc. The ability to execute this kind of attack is a known side effect of having privileged TGS users but normally requires multiple privileges with known weaknesses. This vector is not intentional as it does not require control over the where deployment code is sourced from and _may_ not require remote write access to an instance's `Configuration` directory. This problem is fixed in versions 6.8.0 and above.,8.4,CWE-22

Prior to version 3.3.1 CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining higher privileges. When CubeFS creates new users it creates a piece of sensitive information for the user called the “accessKey”. To create the accesKey CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy to guess and thereby impersonate the created user. An attacker could leverage the predictable random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user to obtain higher privileges. The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than to upgrade.,6.5,CWE-330

CVE-2022-36007,Venice is a Clojure inspired sandboxed Lisp dialect with excellent Java interoperability. A partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths. Assuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ /Users/foo/resources ]` When passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine: `(load-resource test.png)` => loads the file /Users/foo/resources/test.png `(load-resource ../resources-alt/test.png)` => rejected outside the load path When passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths: `(load-resource /Users/foo/resources/test.png)` => loads the file /Users/foo/resources/test.png `(load-resource /Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png)` => loads the file /Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png !!! The latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability. This issue’s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `/Users/foo/resources` the actor can cause loading a resource also from `/Users/foo/resources-alt` but not from `/Users/foo/images`. Versions of Venice before and including v1.10.17 are affected by this issue. Upgrade to Venice >= 1.10.18 if you are on a version < 1.10.18. There are currently no known workarounds.,6.1,CWE-22

CVE-2023-34233,The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. Versions prior to 3.0.2 are vulnerable to command injection via single sign-on(SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 3.0.2 contains a patch for this issue.,8.8,CWE-77
