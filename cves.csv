CVE-2024-9050,A flaw was found in the libreswan client plugin for NetworkManager (NetkworkManager-libreswan) where it fails to properly sanitize the VPN configuration from the local unprivileged user. In this configuration composed by a key-value format the plugin fails to escape special characters leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine by creating a malicious configuration.,7.8,CWE-94

CVE-2024-34714,The Hoppscotch Browser Extension is a browser extension for Hoppscotch a community-driven end-to-end open-source API development ecosystem. Due to an oversight during a change made to the extension in the commit d4e8e4830326f46ba17acd1307977ecd32a85b58 a critical check for the origin list was missed and allowed for messages to be sent to the extension which the extension gladly processed and responded back with the results of while this wasn't supposed to happen and be blocked by the origin not being present in the origin list.

CVE-2024-35846,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory  Christian reports a NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap shrinker.  The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1] and the Red Hat bugzilla [2].  The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag the zswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL.  This is okay in many places like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in memcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of cgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.  Nhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case and I was then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.
