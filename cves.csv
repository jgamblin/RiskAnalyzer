An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24468.,7.8,CWE-125
CVE-2025-21744,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()  On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL pointer dereference occurs.  The following sequence deletes the interface:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_remove_interface()       brcmf_del_if()  Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.  After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is called providing the following sequence:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_proto_detach()       brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()         brcmf_flowring_detach()           brcmf_msgbuf_delete_flowring()             brcmf_msgbuf_remove_flowring()               brcmf_flowring_delete()                 brcmf_get_ifp()                 brcmf_txfinalize()  Since brcmf_get_ip() can and actually will return NULL in this case the call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.  This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.  Although the NULL pointer dereference has only been seen when trying to update the tx statistic all other uses of the ifp pointer have been guarded as well with an early return if ifp is NULL.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-21607,Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. When the Vyper Compiler uses the precompiles EcRecover (0x1) and Identity (0x4) the success flag of the call is not checked. As a consequence an attacker can provide a specific amount of gas to make these calls fail but let the overall execution continue. Then the execution result can be incorrect. Based on EVM's rules after the failed precompile the remaining code has only 1/64 of the pre-call-gas left (as 63/64 were forwarded and spent). Hence only fairly simple executions can follow the failed precompile calls. Therefore we found no significantly impacted real-world contracts. None the less an advisory has been made out of an abundance of caution. This issue is fixed in 0.4.1.,7.5,CWE-670

CVE-2024-23340,@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0 @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API if the URL contains `..` here called double dots the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround don't use `serveStatic`.  ,5.3,CWE-22

CVE-2023-33953,gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS attacks:  - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser - Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser  The unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred per-input-block in the parser and because that could be unbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop with n selected by the client.  The unbounded memory buffering bugs:  - The header size limit check was behind the string reading code so we needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb. - HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0’s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack parser needed to read all of them before concluding a parse. - gRPC’s metadata overflow check was performed per frame so that the following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc…,7.5,CWE-789

CVE-2023-28116,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In versions 4.8 and prior an out-of-bounds write can occur in the BLE L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG operating system.  The network stack of Contiki-NG uses a global buffer (packetbuf) for processing of packets with the size of PACKETBUF_SIZE. In particular when using the BLE L2CAP module with the default configuration the PACKETBUF_SIZE value becomes larger then the actual size of the packetbuf.  When large packets are processed by the L2CAP module a buffer overflow can therefore occur when copying the packet data to the packetbuf. The vulnerability has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be worked around by applying the patch manually.,8.1,CWE-120

CVE-2024-24823,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id even if for different user credentials. In this case the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an attack is high because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 and any versions of the 6.0 development branch contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists but is relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions` endpoint as that is the only one vulnerable.,5.7,CWE-384

CVE-2023-29019,@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected versions for user authentication in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism are vulnerable to session fixation attacks from network and same-site attackers. fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a solution newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. ,8.1,CWE-384

CVE-2022-24828,Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.,8.3,CWE-20

CVE-2022-49516,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: always check VF VSI pointer values  The ice_get_vf_vsi function can return NULL in some cases such as if handling messages during a reset where the VSI is being removed and recreated.  Several places throughout the driver do not bother to check whether this VSI pointer is valid. Static analysis tools maybe report issues because they detect paths where a potentially NULL pointer could be dereferenced.  Fix this by checking the return value of ice_get_vf_vsi everywhere.,5.5,CWE-476
