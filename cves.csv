CVE-2024-41038,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp: Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headers  Check that all fields of a V2 algorithm header fit into the available firmware data buffer.  The wmfw V2 format introduced variable-length strings in the algorithm block header. This means the overall header length is variable and the position of most fields varies depending on the length of the string fields. Each field must be checked to ensure that it does not overflow the firmware data buffer.  As this ia bugfix patch the fixes avoid making any significant change to the existing code. This makes it easier to review and less likely to introduce new bugs.,5.5,CWE-120

CVE-2025-47287,Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0 are affected. The vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to Tornado version 6.50 to receive a patch. As a workaround risk can be mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in a proxy.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2022-49080,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/mempolicy: fix mpol_new leak in shared_policy_replace  If mpol_new is allocated but not used in restart loop mpol_new will be freed via mpol_put before returning to the caller.  But refcnt is not initialized yet so mpol_put could not do the right things and might leak the unused mpol_new.  This would happen if mempolicy was updated on the shared shmem file while the sp->lock has been dropped during the memory allocation.  This issue could be triggered easily with the below code snippet if there are many processes doing the below work at the same time:    shmid = shmget((key_t)5566 1024 * PAGE_SIZE 0666|IPC_CREAT);   shm = shmat(shmid 0 0);   loop many times {     mbind(shm 1024 * PAGE_SIZE MPOL_LOCAL mask maxnode 0);     mbind(shm + 128 * PAGE_SIZE 128 * PAGE_SIZE MPOL_DEFAULT mask           maxnode 0);   },5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-45016,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netem: fix return value if duplicate enqueue fails  There is a bug in netem_enqueue() introduced by commit 5845f706388a (net: netem: fix skb length BUG_ON in __skb_to_sgvec) that can lead to a use-after-free.  This commit made netem_enqueue() always return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS when a packet is duplicated which can cause the parent qdisc's q.qlen to be mistakenly incremented. When this happens qlen_notify() may be skipped on the parent during destruction leaving a dangling pointer for some classful qdiscs like DRR.  There are two ways for the bug happen:  - If the duplicated packet is dropped by rootq->enqueue() and then   the original packet is also dropped. - If rootq->enqueue() sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc   and the original packet is dropped.  In both cases NET_XMIT_SUCCESS is returned even though no packets are enqueued at the netem qdisc.  The fix is to defer the enqueue of the duplicate packet until after the original packet has been guaranteed to return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS.,5.5,CWE-416

CVE-2024-10978,Incorrect privilege assignment in PostgreSQL allows a less-privileged application user to view or change different rows from those intended.  An attack requires the application to use SET ROLE SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION or an equivalent feature.  The problem arises when an application query uses parameters from the attacker or conveys query results to the attacker.  If that query reacts to current_setting('role') or the current user ID it may modify or return data as though the session had not used SET ROLE or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION.  The attacker does not control which incorrect user ID applies.  Query text from less-privileged sources is not a concern here because SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION are not sandboxes for unvetted queries.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1 16.5 15.9 14.14 13.17 and 12.21 are affected.,4.2,CWE-266

CVE-2024-45029,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: tegra: Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safe  On ACPI machines the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to a mutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug:  	BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:585 	...  	Call trace: 	__might_sleep 	__mutex_lock_common 	mutex_lock_nested 	acpi_subsys_runtime_resume 	rpm_resume 	tegra_i2c_xfer  The problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume() the spinlock &dev->power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later rpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() which relies on mutexes triggering the error.  To address this issue devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe considering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-59154,Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License. Openfire’s SASL EXTERNAL mechanism for client TLS authentication contains a vulnerability in how it extracts user identities from X.509 certificates. Instead of parsing the structured ASN.1 data the code calls X509Certificate.getSubjectDN().getName() and applies a regex to look for CN=. This method produces a provider-dependent string that does not escape special characters. In SunJSSE (sun.security.x509.X500Name) for example commas and equals signs inside attribute values are not escaped. As a result a malicious certificate can embed CN= inside another attribute value (e.g. OU=CN=admin). The regex will incorrectly interpret this as a legitimate Common Name and extract admin. If SASL EXTERNAL is enabled and configured to map CNs to user accounts this allows the attacker to impersonate another user. The fix is included in Openfire 5.0.2 and 5.1.0.,5.9,CWE-290

CVE-2025-23168,The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform implements Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using One-Time Passcodes (OTP) delivered via email or SMS. Versa Director accepts untrusted user input when dispatching 2FA codes allowing an attacker who knows a valid username and password to redirect the OTP delivery (SMS/email) to their own device.

CVE-2024-46851,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn10_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()  dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe context passed to dcn10_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.  If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which calls dcn10_set_drr() at some point) we can end up using already nulled function callback fields of struct stream_resource.  The logic in dcn10_set_drr() already tries to avoid this by checking tg against NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and before the next access then we get a race.  Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable and then use this variable for all the operations. This should work as long as nobody frees the resource pool where the timing generators live.
