CVE-2022-36064,Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability impacts users that use Shescape to escape arguments for the Unix shells `Bash` and `Dash` or any not-officially-supported Unix shell; and/or using the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. An attacker can cause polynomial backtracking or quadratic runtime in terms of the input string length due to two Regular Expressions in Shescape that are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This bug has been patched in v1.5.10. For `Dash` only this bug has been patched since v1.5.9. As a workaround a maximum length can be enforced on input strings to Shescape to reduce the impact of the vulnerability. It is not recommended to try and detect vulnerable input strings as the logic for this may end up being vulnerable to ReDoS itself.,5.9,CWE-400

CVE-2024-25622,h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The configuration directives provided by the headers handler allows users to modify the response headers being sent by h2o. The configuration file of h2o has scopes and the inner scopes (e.g. path level) are expected to inherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g. global level). However if a header directive is used in the inner scope all the definition in outer scopes are ignored. This can lead to headers not being modified as expected. Depending on the headers being added or removed unexpectedly this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 123f5e2b65dcdba8f7ef659a00d24bd1249141be.,3.1,CWE-670

CVE-2023-34091,Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. In versions of Kyverno prior to 1.10.0 resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field defined can bypass validate generate or mutate-existing policies even in cases where the `validationFailureAction` field is set to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources pending deletion were being consciously exempted by Kyverno as a way to reduce processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects which are being deleted. However this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user to leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes API server to set the `deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the delete operation as a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this is not applicable to Kubernetes Pods but as an example a Kubernetes Service resource can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass policies. This is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known workaround.,6.5,CWE-285

CVE-2024-47678,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  icmp: change the order of rate limits  ICMP messages are ratelimited :  After the blamed commits the two rate limiters are applied in this order:  1) host wide ratelimit (icmp_global_allow())  2) Per destination ratelimit (inetpeer based)  In order to avoid side-channels attacks we need to apply the per destination check first.  This patch makes the following change :  1) icmp_global_allow() checks if the host wide limit is reached.    But credits are not yet consumed. This is deferred to 3)  2) The per destination limit is checked/updated.    This might add a new node in inetpeer tree.  3) icmp_global_consume() consumes tokens if prior operations succeeded.  This means that host wide ratelimit is still effective in keeping inetpeer tree small even under DDOS.
