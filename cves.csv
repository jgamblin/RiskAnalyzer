CVE-2025-25183,vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Maliciously constructed statements can lead to hash collisions resulting in cache reuse which can interfere with subsequent responses and cause unintended behavior.

This makes it more feasible that someone could try exploit hash collisions. The impact of a collision would be using cache that was generated using different content. Given knowledge of prompts in use and predictable hashing behavior someone could intentionally populate the cache using a prompt known to collide with another prompt in use.

CVE-2023-52486,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm: Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock handling  If we get a deadlock after the fb lookup in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl() we proceed to unref the fb and then retry the whole thing from the top. But we forget to reset the fb pointer back to NULL and so if we then get another error during the retry before the fb lookup we proceed the unref the same fb again without having gotten another reference. The end result is that the fb will (eventually) end up being freed while it's still in use.  Reset fb to NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again until we've done another fb lookup.  This turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2 when doing async flips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The first symptom I saw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop while walking the framebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince it to oops instead and from there it was easier to track down the culprit.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-36971,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race  __dst_negative_advice() does not enforce proper RCU rules when sk->dst_cache must be cleared leading to possible UAF.  RCU rules are that we must first clear sk->sk_dst_cache then call dst_release(old_dst).  Note that sk_dst_reset(sk) is implementing this protocol correctly while __dst_negative_advice() uses the wrong order.  Given that ip6_negative_advice() has special logic against RTF_CACHE this means each of the three ->negative_advice() existing methods must perform the sk_dst_reset() themselves.  Note the check against NULL dst is centralized in __dst_negative_advice() there is no need to duplicate it in various callbacks.  Many thanks to Clement Lecigne for tracking this issue.

CVE-2024-56170,A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before 2.0.0. RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients are supposed to verify. Assuming everything else is correct the most recent version of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions to prevent replays accidental or otherwise. Manifests contain the manifestNumber and thisUpdate fields which can be used to gauge the relevance of a given manifest when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-like sequential number and the latter is the date on which the manifest was created. However the product does not compare the up-to-dateness of the most recently fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such it's prone to a rollback to a previous version if it's served a valid outdated manifest. This leads to outdated route origin validation.,5.3,CWE-346

CVE-2023-33294,An issue was discovered in KaiOS 3.0 before 3.1. The /system/bin/tctweb_server binary exposes a local web server that responds to GET and POST requests on port 2929. The server accepts arbitrary Bash commands and executes them as root. Because it is not permission or context restricted and returns proper CORS headers it's accessible to all websites via the browser. At a bare minimum this allows an attacker to retrieve a list of the user's installed apps notifications and downloads. It also allows an attacker to delete local files and modify system properties including the boolean persist.moz.killswitch property (which would render the device inoperable). This vulnerability is partially mitigated by SELinux which prevents reads writes or modifications to files or permissions within protected partitions.,9.8,CWE-77

CVE-2024-52308,The GitHub CLI version 2.6.1 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution through a malicious codespace SSH server when using `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands. This has been patched in the cli v2.62.0.  Developers connect to remote codespaces through an SSH server running within the devcontainer which is generally provided through the [default devcontainer image]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-... https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration) . GitHub CLI [retrieves SSH connection details]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/inv... https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/invoker.go#L230-L244 ) such as remote username which is used in [executing `ssh` commands]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L2... https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L263 ) for `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands.  This exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute arbitrary code on the user's workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand=echo hacked #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.  In `2.62.0` the remote username information is being validated before being used.,8.0,CWE-77

CVE-2024-39490,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: sr: fix missing sk_buff release in seg6_input_core  The seg6_input() function is responsible for adding the SRH into a packet delegating the operation to the seg6_input_core(). This function uses the skb_cow_head() to ensure that there is sufficient headroom in the sk_buff for accommodating the link-layer header. In the event that the skb_cow_header() function fails the seg6_input_core() catches the error but it does not release the sk_buff which will result in a memory leak.  This issue was introduced in commit af3b5158b89d (ipv6: sr: fix BUG due to headroom too small after SRH push) and persists even after commit 7a3f5b0de364 (netfilter: add netfilter hooks to SRv6 data plane) where the entire seg6_input() code was refactored to deal with netfilter hooks.  The proposed patch addresses the identified memory leak by requiring the seg6_input_core() function to release the sk_buff in the event that skb_cow_head() fails.,6.2,CWE-401
