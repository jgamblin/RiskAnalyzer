CVE-2024-31081,A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.,7.3,CWE-126

CVE-2022-39384,OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0 initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation where reentrancy is not feasible so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround avoid untrusted external calls during initialization.,5.6,CWE-665

CVE-2025-53547,Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to 3.18.4 a specially crafted Chart.yaml file along with a specially linked Chart.lock file can lead to local code execution when dependencies are updated. Fields in a Chart.yaml file that are carried over to a Chart.lock file when dependencies are updated and this file is written can be crafted in a way that can cause execution if that same content were in a file that is executed (e.g. a bash.rc file or shell script). If the Chart.lock file is symlinked to one of these files updating dependencies will write the lock file content to the symlinked file. This can lead to unwanted execution. Helm warns of the symlinked file but did not stop execution due to symlinking. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.4.,8.5,CWE-94

CVE-2024-53267,sigstore-java is a sigstore java client for interacting with sigstore infrastructure. sigstore-java has insufficient verification for a situation where a validly-signed but mismatched bundle is presented as proof of inclusion into a transparency log. This bug impacts clients using any variation of KeylessVerifier.verify(). The verifier may accept a bundle with an unrelated log entry cryptographically verifying everything but fails to ensure the log entry applies to the artifact in question thereby verifying a bundle without any proof the signing event was logged. This allows the creation of a bundle without fulcio certificate and private key combined with an unrelated but time-correct log entry to fake logging of a signing event. A malicious actor using a compromised identity may want to do this to prevent discovery via rekor's log monitors. The signer's identity will still be available to the verifier. The signature on the bundle must still be on the correct artifact for the verifier to pass. sigstore-gradle-plugin and sigstore-maven-plugin are not affected by this as they only provide signing functionality. This issue has been patched in v1.1.0 release with PR #856. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.5,CWE-347

CVE-2024-26710,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB  KASAN is seen to increase stack usage to the point that it was reported to lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).  To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in commit 3e8635fb2e07 (powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with KASAN).  However with a 32KB stack size to begin with the doubling leads to a 64KB stack which causes build errors:   arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)  Although the asm could be reworked in practice a 32KB stack seems sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.  So only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB.,5.5,CWE-770

CVE-2024-36899,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify  The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release() watched_lines is freed by bitmap_free() but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally one of the GPIO chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's read rwsem. Consequently a race condition leads to the use-after-free of watched_lines.  Here is the typical stack when issue happened:  [free] gpio_chrdev_release()   --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed   --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()     --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem           --> __down_write_common()             --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()                   --> schedule_preempt_disabled()                     --> schedule()  [use] st54spi_gpio_dev_release()   --> gpio_free()     --> gpiod_free()       --> gpiod_free_commit()         --> gpiod_line_state_notify()           --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()             --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem             --> notifier_call_chain()               --> lineinfo_changed_notify()                 --> test_bit(xxxx cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free  The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However since the chrdev is being closed userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.  To fix the issue call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain.,7.0,CWE-362
