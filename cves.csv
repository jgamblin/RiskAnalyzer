CVE-2024-49979,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: gso: fix tcp fraglist segmentation after pull from frag_list  Detect tcp gso fraglist skbs with corrupted geometry (see below) and pass these to skb_segment instead of skb_segment_list as the first can segment them correctly.  Valid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs - consist of two or more segments - the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size - one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment - all but the last must be gso_size  Optional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can modify these skbs breaking these invariants.  In extreme cases they pull all data into skb linear. For TCP this causes a NULL ptr deref in __tcpv4_gso_segment_list_csum at tcp_hdr(seg->next).  Detect invalid geometry due to pull by checking head_skb size. Don't just drop as this may blackhole a destination. Convert to be able to pass to regular skb_segment.  Approach and description based on a patch by Willem de Bruijn.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-49376,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: sd: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference  If sd_probe() sees an early error before sdkp->device is initialized sd_zbc_release_disk() is called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when sd_is_zoned() is called inside that function. Avoid this by removing the call to sd_zbc_release_disk() in sd_probe() error path.  This change is safe and does not result in zone information memory leakage because the zone information for a zoned disk is allocated only when sd_revalidate_disk() is called at which point sdkp->disk_dev is fully set resulting in sd_disk_release() being called when needed to cleanup a disk zone information using sd_zbc_release_disk().,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-56593,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: Fix oops due to NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw()  This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug in brcmfmac that occurs when a high 'sd_sgentry_align' value applies (e.g. 512) and a lot of queued SKBs are sent from the pkt queue.  The problem is the number of entries in the pre-allocated sgtable it is nents = max(rxglom_size txglom_size) + max(rxglom_size txglom_size) >> 4 + 1. Given the default [rt]xglom_size=32 it's actually 35 which is too small. Worst case the pkt queue can end up with 64 SKBs. This occurs when a new SKB is added for each original SKB if tailroom isn't enough to hold tail_pad. At least one sg entry is needed for each SKB. So eventually the skb_queue_walk loop in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw may run out of sg entries. This makes sg_next return NULL and this causes the oops.  The patch sets nents to max(rxglom_size txglom_size) * 2 to be able handle the worst-case. Btw. this requires only 64-35=29 * 16 (or 20 if CONFIG_NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH) = 464 additional bytes of memory.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-47084,Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability is related to **CORS origin validation** where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attacker’s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially attackers can upload files steal authentication tokens and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround users can manually enforce stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.,8.3,CWE-285

CVE-2024-9062,The Archify application contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to insufficient client validation in its privileged helper tool com.oct4pie.archifyhelper which is exposed via XPC. Archify follows the factored applications model delegating privileged operations—such as arbitrary file deletion and file permission changes—to this helper running as root. However the helper does not verify the code signature entitlements or signing flags of the connecting client. Although macOS provides secure validation mechanisms like auditToken these are not implemented. As a result any local process can establish a connection to the helper and invoke privileged functionality leading to unauthorized execution of actions with root-level privileges.,7.8,CWE-306

CVE-2024-41012,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected  When fcntl_setlk() races with close() it removes the created lock with do_lock_file_wait(). However LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock. Separately posix_lock_file() could also fail to remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range in the middle).  After the bug has been triggered use-after-free reads will occur in lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used to read arbitrary kernel memory but can't corrupt kernel memory.  Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead which is designed to reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and files_struct and is also used by filp_flush().,6.3,CWE-416
CVE-2024-11326,The Campaign Monitor Forms by Optin Cat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to and including 2.5.7.

The specific flaw exists within the archive extraction functionality. A crafted archive entry can cause the creation of an arbitrary file without the Mark-Of-The-Web. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-23156.,4.3,CWE-693
CVE-2022-42333,x86/HVM pinned cache attributes mis-handling T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] To allow cachability control for HVM guests with passed through devices an interface exists to explicitly override defaults which would otherwise be put in place. While not exposed to the affected guests themselves the interface specifically exists for domains controlling such guests. This interface may therefore be used by not fully privileged entities e.g. qemu running deprivileged in Dom0 or qemu running in a so called stub-domain. With this exposure it is an issue that - the number of the such controlled regions was unbounded (CVE-2022-42333) - installation and removal of such regions was not properly serialized (CVE-2022-42334).,8.6,CWE-770
CVE-2025-3515,The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in all versions up to and including 1.3.8.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the plugin's blacklist and upload .phar or other dangerous file types on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible on the servers that are configured to handle .phar files as executable PHP scripts particularly in default Apache+mod_php configurations where the file extension is not strictly validated before being passed to the PHP interpreter.,8.1,CWE-434
CVE-2025-57771,Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users' editors.

CVE-2024-47712,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: wilc1000: fix potential RCU dereference issue in wilc_parse_join_bss_param  In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function the TSF field of the `ies` structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is unlocked. According to RCU usage rules this is illegal. Reusing this pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior including accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.  This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.  To address this the TSF value is now stored in a local variable `ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is then assigned using this local variable ensuring that the TSF value is safely accessed.,5.5,CWE-476
