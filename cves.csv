CVE-2024-39496,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free due to race with dev replace  While loading a zone's info during creation of a block group we can race with a device replace operation and then trigger a use-after-free on the device that was just replaced (source device of the replace operation).  This happens because at btrfs_load_zone_info() we extract a device from the chunk map into a local variable and then use the device while not under the protection of the device replace rwsem. So if there's a device replace operation happening when we extract the device and that device is the source of the replace operation we will trigger a use-after-free if before we finish using the device the replace operation finishes and frees the device.  Fix this by enlarging the critical section under the protection of the device replace rwsem so that all uses of the device are done inside the critical section.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-46845,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing/timerlat: Only clear timer if a kthread exists  The timerlat tracer can use user space threads to check for osnoise and timer latency. If the program using this is killed via a SIGTERM the threads are shutdown one at a time and another tracing instance can start up resetting the threads before they are fully closed. That causes the hrtimer assigned to the kthread to be shutdown and freed twice when the dying thread finally closes the file descriptors causing a use-after-free bug.  Only cancel the hrtimer if the associated thread is still around. Also add the interface_lock around the resetting of the tlat_var->kthread.  Note this is just a quick fix that can be backported to stable. A real fix is to have a better synchronization between the shutdown of old threads and the starting of new ones.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-22204,Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. Versions 0.8.3 and prior have a limited file write vulnerability when the configuration options in Whoogle are enabled. The `config` function in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `name` variable on line 447 and `config_data` variable on line 437. The `name` variable is insecurely concatenated in `os.path.join` leading to path manipulation. The POST data from the `config_data` variable is saved with `pickle.dump` which leads to a limited file write. However the data that is saved is earlier transformed into a dictionary and the `url` key value pair is added before the file is saved on the system. All in all the issue allows us to save and overwrite files on the system that the application has permissions to with a dictionary containing arbitrary data and the `url` key value which is a limited file write. Version 0.8.4 contains a patch for this issue.,5.3,CWE-22

The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-26318.,6.8,CWE-121

CVE-2024-55553,In FRRouting (FRR) before 10.3 from 6.0 onward all routes are re-validated if the total size of an update received via RTR exceeds the internal socket's buffer size default 4K on most OSes. An attacker can use this to trigger re-parsing of the RIB for FRR routers using RTR by causing more than this number of updates during an update interval (usually 30 minutes). Additionally this effect regularly occurs organically. Furthermore an attacker can use this to trigger route validation continuously. Given that routers with large full tables may need more than 30 minutes to fully re-validate the table continuous issuance/withdrawal of large numbers of ROA may be used to impact the route handling performance of all FRR instances using RPKI globally. Additionally the re-validation will cause heightened BMP traffic to ingestors. Fixed Versions: 10.0.3 10.1.2 10.2.1 >= 10.3.,7.5,CWE-404
