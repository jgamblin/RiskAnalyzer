CVE-2024-47712,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: wilc1000: fix potential RCU dereference issue in wilc_parse_join_bss_param  In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function the TSF field of the `ies` structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is unlocked. According to RCU usage rules this is illegal. Reusing this pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior including accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.  This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.  To address this the TSF value is now stored in a local variable `ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is then assigned using this local variable ensuring that the TSF value is safely accessed.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-24817,Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0 helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0 and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig.

CVE-2022-3215,NIOHTTP1 and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and inject those newlines into the returned HTTP response. This capability allows users to work around security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests which can lead to XSS cache poisoning and a number of other flaws. This issue was resolved by adding validation to the HTTPHeaders type ensuring that there's no whitespace incorrectly present in the HTTP headers provided by users. As the existing API surface is non-failable all invalid characters are replaced by linear whitespace.,7.5,CWE-113
