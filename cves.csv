CVE-2025-21704,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before access  If the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification we can't calculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notification instead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data which can lead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases between fragments causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap.  This issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however it only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1 (cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications).  A mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace has opened /dev/ttyACM*; but if ModemManager is running ModemManager will do that automatically depending on the USB device's vendor/product IDs and its other interfaces.,7.8,CWE-787
CVE-2025-21636,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: sysctl: plpmtud_probe_interval: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only   from the opener's netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases resulting in an 'Oops'   (null-ptr-deref) e.g. when the current task is exiting as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using container_of().  Note that table->data could also be used directly as this is the only member needed from the 'net' structure but that would increase the size of this fix to use '*data' everywhere 'net->sctp.probe_interval' is used.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-40027,Keystone is an open source headless CMS for Node.js — built with GraphQL and React. When `ui.isAccessAllowed` is set as `undefined` the `adminMeta` GraphQL query is publicly accessible (no session required). This is different to the behaviour of the default AdminUI middleware which by default will only be publicly accessible (no session required) if a `session` strategy is not defined. This vulnerability does not affect developers using the `@keystone-6/auth` package or any users that have written their own `ui.isAccessAllowed` (that is to say `isAccessAllowed` is not `undefined`). This vulnerability does affect users who believed that their `session` strategy will by default enforce that `adminMeta` is inaccessible by the public in accordance with that strategy; akin to the behaviour of the AdminUI middleware. This vulnerability has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version `5.5.1`. Users are advised to upgrade.
