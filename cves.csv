CVE-2024-27934,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.36.2 and prior to version 1.40.3 use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure resulting in arbitrary code execution. Use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions. This bug is known to be exploitable for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations. Version 1.40.3 fixes this issue.,8.4,CWE-416

CVE-2024-12797,Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated because handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode is set.  Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not detected by clients.  RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server and the server likewise enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.  Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result() and those that do and take appropriate action are not affected.  This issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.  The FIPS modules in 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.,6.3,CWE-392

CVE-2023-44981,Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in Apache ZooKeeper. If SASL Quorum Peer authentication is enabled in ZooKeeper (quorum.auth.enableSasl=true) the authorization is done by verifying that the instance part in SASL authentication ID is listed in zoo.cfg server list. The instance part in SASL auth ID is optional and if it's missing like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM' the authorization check will be skipped. As a result an arbitrary endpoint could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader essentially giving it complete read-write access to the data tree. Quorum Peer authentication is not enabled by default.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1 3.8.3 3.7.2 which fixes the issue.  Alternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.  See the documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.,9.1,CWE-639

CVE-2025-21685,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86: lenovo-yoga-tab2-pro-1380-fastcharger: fix serdev race  The yt2_1380_fc_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open() before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's receive_buf handler as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.  This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1 (platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition) where devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the device.  Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via devm_serdev_device_open().  Note serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control() calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.,4.7,CWE-476

CVE-2024-27303,electron-builder is a solution to package and build a ready for distribution Electron Proton Native app for macOS Windows and Linux. A vulnerability that only affects eletron-builder prior to 24.13.2 in Windows the NSIS installer makes a system call to open cmd.exe via NSExec in the `.nsh` installer script. NSExec by default searches the current directory of where the installer is located before searching `PATH`. This means that if an attacker can place a malicious executable file named cmd.exe in the same folder as the installer the installer will run the malicious file. Version 24.13.2 fixes this issue. No known workaround exists. The code executes at the installer-level before the app is present on the system so there's no way to check if it exists in a current installer.,7.3,CWE-426

CVE-2024-35187,Stalwart Mail Server is an open-source mail server. Prior to version 0.8.0 attackers who achieved Arbitrary Code Execution as the stalwart-mail user (including web interface admins) can gain complete root access to the system. Usually system services are run as a separate user (not as root) to isolate an attacker with Arbitrary Code Execution to the current service. Therefore other system services and the system itself remains protected in case of a successful attack. stalwart-mail runs as a separate user but it can give itself full privileges again in a simple way so this protection is practically ineffective. Server admins who handed out the admin credentials to the mail server but didn't want to hand out complete root access to the system as well as any attacked user when the attackers gained Arbitrary Code Execution using another vulnerability may be vulnerable. Version 0.8.0 contains a patch for the issue.,9.1,CWE-863

CVE-2023-32680,Metabase is an open source business analytics engine. To edit SQL Snippets Metabase should have required people to be in at least one group with native query editing permissions to a database–but affected versions of Metabase didn't enforce that requirement. This lack of enforcement meant that: Anyone–including people in sandboxed groups–could edit SQL snippets. They could edit snippets via the API or in the application UI when editing the metadata for a model based on a SQL question and people in sandboxed groups could edit a SQL snippet used in a query that creates their sandbox. If the snippet contained logic that restricted which data that person could see they could potentially edit that snippet and change their level of data access. The permissions model for SQL snippets has been fixed in Metabase versions 0.46.3 0.45.4 0.44.7 1.46.3 1.45.4 and 1.44.7. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2023-3138,A vulnerability was found in libX11. The security flaw occurs because the functions in src/InitExt.c in libX11 do not check that the values provided for the Request Event or Error IDs are within the bounds of the arrays that those functions write to using those IDs as array indexes. They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.,7.5,CWE-119
