CVE-2025-39917,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix out-of-bounds dynptr write in bpf_crypto_crypt  Stanislav reported that in bpf_crypto_crypt() the destination dynptr's size is not validated to be at least as large as the source dynptr's size before calling into the crypto backend with 'len = src_len'. This can result in an OOB write when the destination is smaller than the source.  Concretely in mentioned function psrc and pdst are both linear buffers fetched from each dynptr:    psrc = __bpf_dynptr_data(src src_len);   [...]   pdst = __bpf_dynptr_data_rw(dst dst_len);   [...]   err = decrypt ?         ctx->type->decrypt(ctx->tfm psrc pdst src_len piv) :         ctx->type->encrypt(ctx->tfm psrc pdst src_len piv);  The crypto backend expects pdst to be large enough with a src_len length that can be written. Add an additional src_len > dst_len check and bail out if it's the case. Note that these kfuncs are accessible under root privileges only.,7.8,CWE-787

The nvdimm_bus_lock() is protecting against unregistration multiple simultaneous ops callers and preventing activate_show() from racing activate_store(). For the first 2 the lock is redundant. Unregistration already flushes all ops users and sysfs already prevents multiple threads to be active in an ops handler at the same time. For the last userspace should already be waiting for its last activate_store() to complete and does not need activate_show() to flush the write side so this lock usage can be deleted in these attributes.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-47056,SummaryThis advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where sensitive .env configuration files may be directly accessible via a web browser. This exposure could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information including database credentials API keys and other critical system configurations.  Sensitive Information Disclosure via .env File Exposure: The .env file which typically contains environment variables and sensitive application configurations is directly accessible via a web browser due to missing web server configurations that restrict access to such files. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to view the contents of this file by simply navigating to its URL.  MitigationUpdate Mautic to the latest Mautic version.  By default Mautic does not use .env files for production data.  For Apache users: Ensure your web server is configured to respect .htaccess files.  For Nginx users: As Nginx does not inherently support .htaccess files you must manually add a configuration block to your Nginx server configuration to deny access to .env files. Add the following to your Nginx configuration for the Mautic site:  location ~ /\.env {     deny all; }      After modifying your Nginx configuration remember to reload or restart your Nginx service for the changes to take effect.,5.1,CWE-312

CVE-2024-46760,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtw88: usb: schedule rx work after everything is set up  Right now it's possible to hit NULL pointer dereference in rtw_rx_fill_rx_status on hw object and/or its fields because initialization routine can start getting USB replies before rtw_dev is fully setup.  The stack trace looks like this:  rtw_rx_fill_rx_status rtw8821c_query_rx_desc rtw_usb_rx_handler ... queue_work rtw_usb_read_port_complete ... usb_submit_urb rtw_usb_rx_resubmit rtw_usb_init_rx rtw_usb_probe  So while we do the async stuff rtw_usb_probe continues and calls rtw_register_hw which does all kinds of initialization (e.g. via ieee80211_register_hw) that rtw_rx_fill_rx_status relies on.  Fix this by moving the first usb_submit_urb after everything is set up.

CVE-2023-46244,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions it's possible for a user to write a script in which any velocity content is executed with the right of any other document content author. Since this API require programming right and the user does not have it the expected result is `$doc.document.authors.contentAuthor` (not executed script) unfortunately with the security vulnerability it is possible for the attacker to get `XWiki.superadmin` which shows that the title was executed with the right of the unmodified document. This has been patched in XWiki versions 14.10.7 and 15.2RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,9.1,CWE-863
CVE-2025-12539,The TNC Toolbox: Web Performance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to and including 1.4.2. This is due to the plugin storing cPanel API credentials (hostname username and API key) in files within the web-accessible wp-content directory without adequate protection in the Tnc_Wp_Toolbox_Settings::save_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve these credentials and use them to interact with the cPanel API which can lead to arbitrary file uploads remote code execution and full compromise of the hosting environment.,10.0,CWE-922
CVE-2024-4459,The Themesflat Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's widget's titles in all versions up to and including 2.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

CVE-2024-50335,SuiteCRM is an open-source enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. The Publish Key field in SuiteCRM's Edit Profile page is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This can be exploited to steal CSRF tokens and perform unauthorized actions such as creating new administrative users without proper authentication. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the Publish Key field within the SuiteCRM application. When an attacker injects a malicious script it gets executed within the context of an authenticated user's session. The injected script (o.js) then leverages the captured CSRF token to forge requests that create new administrative users effectively compromising the integrity and security of the CRM instance. This issue has been addressed in versions 7.14.6 and 8.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.9,CWE-79
