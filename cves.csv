CVE-2023-34453,snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked multiplications an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1 causing a fatal error.  The function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array which might cause exceptions such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double float long and short each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.  Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.,5.9,CWE-190

CVE-2025-54808,Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinKNOW software at or prior to version 24.11 stores authentication tokens in a file located in the system's temporary directory (/tmp) on the host machine. This directory is typically world-readable allowing any local user or application to access the token. If the token is leaked (e.g. via malware infection or other local exploit) and remote access is enabled it can be used to establish unauthorized remote connections to the sequencer. Remote access must be enabled for remote exploitation to succeed. This may occur either because the user has enabled remote access for legitimate operational reasons or because malware with elevated privileges (e.g. sudo access) enables it without user consent. This vulnerability can be chained with remote access capabilities to generate a developer token from a remote device. Developer tokens can be created with arbitrary expiration dates enabling persistent access to the sequencer and bypassing standard authentication mechanisms.,7.8,CWE-522

CVE-2022-30698,NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.16.1 is vulnerable to a novel type of the ghost domain names attack. The vulnerability works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a subdomain of a rogue domain name. The rogue nameserver returns delegation information for the subdomain that updates Unbound's delegation cache. This action can be repeated before expiry of the delegation information by querying Unbound for a second level subdomain which the rogue nameserver provides new delegation information. Since Unbound is a child-centric resolver the ever-updating child delegation information can keep a rogue domain name resolvable long after revocation. From version 1.16.2 on Unbound checks the validity of parent delegation records before using cached delegation information.,6.5,CWE-613

CVE-2022-35949,undici is an HTTP/1.1 client written from scratch for Node.js.`undici` is vulnerable to SSRF (Server-side Request Forgery) when an application takes in **user input** into the `path/pathname` option of `undici.request`. If a user specifies a URL such as `http://127.0.0.1` or `//127.0.0.1` ```js const undici = require(undici) undici.request({origin: http://example.com pathname: //127.0.0.1}) ``` Instead of processing the request as `http://example.org//127.0.0.1` (or `http://example.org/http://127.0.0.1` when `http://127.0.0.1 is used`) it actually processes the request as `http://127.0.0.1/` and sends it to `http://127.0.0.1`. If a developer passes in user input into `path` parameter of `undici.request` it can result in an _SSRF_ as they will assume that the hostname cannot change when in actual fact it can change because the specified path parameter is combined with the base URL. This issue was fixed in `undici@5.8.1`. The best workaround is to validate user input before passing it to the `undici.request` call.,5.3,CWE-918

CVE-2023-52501,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Do not attempt to read past commit  When iterating over the ring buffer while the ring buffer is active the writer can corrupt the reader. There's barriers to help detect this and handle it but that code missed the case where the last event was at the very end of the page and has only 4 bytes left.  The checks to detect the corruption by the writer to reads needs to see the length of the event. If the length in the first 4 bytes is zero then the length is stored in the second 4 bytes. But if the writer is in the process of updating that code there's a small window where the length in the first 4 bytes could be zero even though the length is only 4 bytes. That will cause rb_event_length() to read the next 4 bytes which could happen to be off the allocated page.  To protect against this fail immediately if the next event pointer is less than 8 bytes from the end of the commit (last byte of data) as all events must be a minimum of 8 bytes anyway.,7.1,CWE-125
