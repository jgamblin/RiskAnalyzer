CVE-2021-32846,HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this situation there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS` but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and under certain circumstance memory corruption.

CVE-2025-21915,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cdx: Fix possible UAF error in driver_override_show()  Fixed a possible UAF problem in driver_override_show() in drivers/cdx/cdx.c  This function driver_override_show() is part of DEVICE_ATTR_RW which includes both driver_override_show() and driver_override_store(). These functions can be executed concurrently in sysfs.  The driver_override_store() function uses driver_set_override() to update the driver_override value and driver_set_override() internally locks the device (device_lock(dev)). If driver_override_show() reads cdx_dev->driver_override without locking it could potentially access a freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string concurrently. This could lead to printing a kernel address which is a security risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read by all users.  Additionally a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c as well as many other bus drivers where device_lock() is taken in the show function and it has been working without issues.  This potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis tool which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify data races and atomicity violations.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-22462,Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin Text. The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. Another user needs to edit the same Text panel and click on Markdown or HTML for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.

CVE-2023-31129,The Contiki-NG operating system versions 4.8 and prior can be triggered to dereference a NULL pointer in the message handling code for IPv6 router solicitiations. Contiki-NG contains an implementation of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) in the module `os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c`. The ND protocol includes a message type called Router Solicitation (RS) which is used to locate routers and update their address information via the SLLAO (Source Link-Layer Address Option). If the indicated source address changes a given neighbor entry is set to the STALE state.  The message handler does not check for RS messages with an SLLAO that indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor entry can actually be created for the indicated address. The resulting pointer is used without a check leading to the dereference of a NULL pointer of type `uip_ds6_nbr_t`.  The problem has been patched in the `develop` branch of Contiki-NG and will be included in the upcoming 4.9 release. As a workaround users can apply Contiki-NG pull request #2271 to patch the problem directly.,7.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-56132,LiquidFiles filetransfer server is vulnerable to a user enumeration issue in its password reset functionality. The application returns distinguishable responses for valid and invalid email addresses allowing unauthenticated attackers to determine the existence of user accounts. Version 4.2 introduces user-based lockout mechanisms to mitigate brute-force attacks user enumeration remains possible by default. In versions prior to 4.2 no such user-level protection is in place only basic IP-based rate limiting is enforced. This IP-based protection can be bypassed by distributing requests across multiple IPs (e.g. rotating IP or proxies). Effectively bypassing both login and password reset security controls. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to enumerate valid email addresses registered for the application increasing the risk of follow-up attacks such as password spraying.,7.3,CWE-305

CVE-2024-38586,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  r8169: Fix possible ring buffer corruption on fragmented Tx packets.  An issue was found on the RTL8125b when transmitting small fragmented packets whereby invalid entries were inserted into the transmit ring buffer subsequently leading to calls to dma_unmap_single() with a null address.  This was caused by rtl8169_start_xmit() not noticing changes to nr_frags which may occur when small packets are padded (to work around hardware quirks) in rtl8169_tso_csum_v2().  To fix this postpone inspecting nr_frags until after any padding has been applied.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2021-46904,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration  Multiple ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.  The get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number but doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller later. But before this assignment calls to get_free_serial_index() would return the same minor number.  Fix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number immediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor() to better reflect what it does. Similary rename set_serial_by_index() to release_minor() and modify it to free up the minor number of the given hso_serial. Every obtain_minor() should have corresponding release_minor() call.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-23611,LTI Consumer XBlock implements the consumer side of the LTI specification enabling integration of third-party LTI provider tools. Versions 7.0.0 and above prior to 7.2.2 are vulnerable to Missing Authorization.  Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX platform can post a grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows or can guess the block location for that XBlock. An LTI tool submits scores to the edX platform for line items. The code that uploads that score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to upload the grades for by reading the resource_link_id field of the associated line item. The LTI tool may submit any value for the resource_link_id field allowing a malicious LTI tool to submit scores for any LTI XBlock on the platform. The impact is a loss of integrity for LTI XBlock grades. This issue is patched in 7.2.2. No workarounds exist.,5.4,CWE-862

CVE-2024-32644,Evmos is a scalable high-throughput Proof-of-Stake EVM blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. Prior to 17.0.0 there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage` we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.  The issue has been patched in versions >=V17.0.0.,9.1,CWE-662
