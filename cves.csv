CVE-2022-49493,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: rt5645: Fix errorenous cleanup order  There is a logic error when removing rt5645 device as the function rt5645_i2c_remove() first cancel the &rt5645->jack_detect_work and delete the &rt5645->btn_check_timer latter. However since the timer handler rt5645_btn_check_callback() will re-queue the jack_detect_work this cleanup order is buggy.

CVE-2022-46172,authentik is an open-source Identity provider focused on flexibility and versatility. In versions prior to 2022.10.4 and 2022.11.4 any authenticated user can create an arbitrary number of accounts through the default flows. This would circumvent any policy in a situation where it is undesirable for users to create new accounts by themselves. This may also affect other applications as these new basic accounts would exist throughout the SSO infrastructure. By default the newly created accounts cannot be logged into as no password reset exists by default. However password resets are likely to be enabled by most installations. This vulnerability pertains to the user context used in the default-user-settings-flow /api/v3/flows/instances/default-user-settings-flow/execute/.

CVE-2025-27789,Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers` and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.,6.2,CWE-1333

CVE-2022-39205,Onedev is an open source self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. In versions of Onedev prior to 7.3.0 unauthenticated users can take over a OneDev instance if there is no properly configured reverse proxy. The /git-prereceive-callback endpoint is used by the pre-receive git hook on the server to check for branch protections during a push event. It is only intended to be accessed from localhost but the check relies on the X-Forwarded-For header. Invoking this endpoint leads to the execution of one of various git commands. The environment variables of this command execution can be controlled via query parameters.

Prior to commit 6740e75c0fdc7ba095baf88e9f5e4f3e15cfd8ba edxapp has no built-in protection against downloading the python_lib.zip asset from courses which is a concern since it often contains custom grading code or answers to course problems. This potentially affects any course using custom Python-graded problem blocks. The openedx/configuration repo has had a patch since 2016 in the form of an nginx rule but this was only intended as a temporary mitigation. As the configuration repo has been deprecated and we have not been able to locate any similar protection in Tutor it is likely that most deployments have no protection against python_lib.zip being downloaded.

CVE-2022-48707,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder  Not all decoders have a reset callback.  The CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port to have no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes there are none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoder instance without a commit/reset callback.  Prior to this patch the ->reset() callback was called unconditionally when calling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge 1 Root Port and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL type 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null pointer dereference.  Before the fix a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region and a pass through decoder is reset.  The issue can be reproduced as below     1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a     single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.     2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-57946,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio-blk: don't keep queue frozen during system suspend  Commit 4ce6e2db00de (virtio-blk: Ensure no requests in virtqueues before deleting vqs.) replaces queue quiesce with queue freeze in virtio-blk's PM callbacks. And the motivation is to drain inflight IOs before suspending.  block layer's queue freeze looks very handy but it is also easy to cause deadlock such as any attempt to call into bio_queue_enter() may run into deadlock if the queue is frozen in current context. There are all kinds of ->suspend() called in suspend context so keeping queue frozen in the whole suspend context isn't one good idea.
