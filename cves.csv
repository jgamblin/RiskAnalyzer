CVE,Description,CVSS3_BaseScore,CWE
CVE-2023-0466,The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.  As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function.  Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.  Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.,5.3,CWE-295

CVE-2024-32644,Evmos is a scalable high-throughput Proof-of-Stake EVM blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. Prior to 17.0.0 there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage` we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.  The issue has been patched in versions >=V17.0.0.,9.1,CWE-662

A write_lock(&pointers_lock) => read_lock(&pointers_lock) deadlock bug and a sb_bread() with write_lock(&pointers_lock) bug were introduced by Replace BKL for chain locking with sysvfs-private rwlock in Linux 2.5.12.  Then [PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix in Linux 2.6.8 fixed the former bug by moving pointers_lock lock to the callers but instead introduced a sb_bread() with read_lock(&pointers_lock) bug (which made this problem easier to hit).  Al Viro suggested that why not to do like get_branch()/get_block()/ find_shared() in Minix filesystem does. And doing like that is almost a revert of [PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix except that get_branch()  from with find_shared() is called without write_lock(&pointers_lock).,5.3,CWE-667

CVE-2024-31991,Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0 the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server. Based on the content of the response it will either parse the content or disregard it. This function nor those that call it add any restrictions on the URL that can be provided nor is it restricted to being an FQDN (i.e. an IP address can be provided). As this function’s return will be handled differently by its caller depending on the response it is possible for an attacker to use this functionality to positively identify HTTP(s) servers on the local network with any IP/port combination. This issue can result in any authenticated user being able to map HTTP servers on a local network that the Mealie service has access to. Note that by default any user can create an account on a Mealie server and that the default changeme@example.com user is available with its hard-coded password. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.,4.1,CWE-918

CVE-2024-25625,Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. A potential security vulnerability has been discovered in `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4. The vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the `invitationLinkAction` function of the UserController specifically in the way `$loginUrl` trusts user input.  The host header from incoming HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs. An attacker can manipulate the HTTP host header in requests to the /admin/user/invitationlink endpoint resulting in the generation of URLs with the attacker's domain. In fact if a host header is injected in the POST request the $loginURL parameter is constructed with this unvalidated host header. It is then used to send an invitation email to the provided user. This vulnerability can be used to perform phishing attacks by making the URLs in the invitation links emails point to an attacker-controlled domain. Version 1.3.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability. The maintainers recommend validating the host header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It would also be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the incoming host header is not recognized or is absent.,8.1,CWE-74

CVE-2024-24819,icingaweb2-module-incubator is a working project of bleeding edge Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class `gipfl\Web\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default.

CVE-2022-3215,NIOHTTP1 and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and inject those newlines into the returned HTTP response. This capability allows users to work around security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests which can lead to XSS cache poisoning and a number of other flaws. This issue was resolved by adding validation to the HTTPHeaders type ensuring that there's no whitespace incorrectly present in the HTTP headers provided by users. As the existing API surface is non-failable all invalid characters are replaced by linear whitespace.,7.5,CWE-113

CVE-2024-47812,ImportDump is an extension for mediawiki designed to automate user import requests. Anyone who can edit the interface strings of a wiki (typically administrators and interface admins) can embed XSS payloads in the messages for dates and thus XSS anyone who views Special:RequestImportQueue. This issue has been patched in commit `d054b95` and all users are advised to apply this commit to their branch. Users unable to upgrade may either Prevent access to Special:RequestImportQueue on all wikis except for the global wiki; and If an interface administrator (or equivalent) level protection is available (which is not provided by default) on the global wiki protect the affected messages up to that level. This causes the XSS to be virtually useless as users with those rights can already edit Javascript pages. Or Prevent access to Special:RequestImportQueue altogether.,6.0,CWE-79

CVE-2023-36823,Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Using carefully crafted input an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSS through Sanitize starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 6.0.2 when Sanitize is configured to use the built-in relaxed config or when using a custom config that allows `style` elements and one or more CSS at-rules. This could result in cross-site scripting or other undesired behavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are rendered in a browser. Sanitize 6.0.2 performs additional escaping of CSS in `style` element content which fixes this issue. Users who are unable to upgrade can prevent this issue by using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow `style` elements using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow CSS at-rules or by manually escaping the character sequence `</` as `<\/` in `style` element content.,7.1,CWE-79
