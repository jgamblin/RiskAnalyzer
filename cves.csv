CVE-2023-52381,Script injection vulnerability in the email module.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect service confidentiality integrity and availability.,9.8,CWE-94
CVE-2022-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()  On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space the ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs even though the CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the file the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to wake waiters as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.  While debugging this I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is OK to do) and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is not fine and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).   Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1204705,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-41952,Zitadel is an open source identity management system. ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called Ignoring unknown usernames which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesn't exist and report Username or Password invalid. Due to a implementation change to prevent deadlocks calling the database the flag would not be correctly respected in all cases and an attacker would gain information if an account exist within ZITADEL since the error message shows object not found instead of the generic error message.

Until WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15 the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock’s instance. For example If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token discovered using another exploit via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations.,4.6,CWE-918

CVE-2023-52531,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix a memory corruption issue  A few lines above space is kzalloc()'ed for: 	sizeof(struct iwl_nvm_data) + 	sizeof(struct ieee80211_channel) + 	sizeof(struct ieee80211_rate)  'mvm->nvm_data' is a 'struct iwl_nvm_data' so it is fine.  At the end of this structure there is the 'channels' flex array. Each element is of type 'struct ieee80211_channel'. So only 1 element is allocated in this array.  When doing:   mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].channels = mvm->nvm_data->channels; We point at the first element of the 'channels' flex array. So this is fine.  However when doing:   mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].bitrates = 			(void *)((u8 *)mvm->nvm_data->channels + 1); because of the (u8 *) cast we add only 1 to the address of the beginning of the flex array.  It is likely that we want point at the 'struct ieee80211_rate' allocated just after.  Remove the spurious casting so that the pointer arithmetic works as expected.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2024-53848,check-jsonschema is a CLI and set of pre-commit hooks for jsonschema validation. The default cache strategy uses the basename of a remote schema as the name of the file in the cache e.g. `https://example.org/schema.json` will be stored as `schema.json`. This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL e.g. `https://example.evil.org/schema.json` they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used instead of the appropriate schema. Such a cache confusion attack could be used to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected. This issue has been patched in version 0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. A few workarounds exist: 1. Users can use `--no-cache` to disable caching. 2. Users can use `--cache-filename` to select filenames for use in the cache or to ensure that other usages do not overwrite the cached schema. (Note: this flag is being deprecated as part of the remediation effort.) 3. Users can explicitly download the schema before use as a local file as in `curl -LOs https://example.org/schema.json; check-jsonschema --schemafile ./schema.json`,7.1,CWE-349

CVE-2023-37908,XWiki Rendering is a generic Rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax into another syntax. The cleaning of attributes during XHTML rendering introduced in version 14.6-rc-1 allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid attribute names. This can be exploited e.g. via the link syntax in any content that supports XWiki syntax like comments in XWiki. When a user moves the mouse over a malicious link the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. When this user is a privileged user who has programming rights this allows server-side code execution with programming rights impacting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the XWiki instance. While this attribute was correctly recognized as not allowed the attribute was still printed with a prefix `data-xwiki-translated-attribute-` without further cleaning or validation. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by removing characters not allowed in data attributes and then validating the cleaned attribute again. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.,9.0,CWE-83

CVE-2022-49286,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tpm: use try_get_ops() in tpm-space.c  As part of the series conversion to remove nested TPM operations:  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190205224723.19671-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/  exposure of the chip->tpm_mutex was removed from much of the upper level code.  In this conversion tpm2_del_space() was missed.  This didn't matter much because it's usually called closely after a converted operation so there's only a very tiny race window where the chip can be removed before the space flushing is done which causes a NULL deref on the mutex.  However there are reports of this window being hit in practice so fix this by converting tpm2_del_space() to use tpm_try_get_ops() which performs all the teardown checks before acquring the mutex.,4.7,CWE-476

According to FSCT-2022-0062 there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus authentication bypass issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication functions on the basis of a MAC/IP whitelist with inactivity timeout to which an authenticated client's MAC/IP is stored. UDP traffic can be spoofed to bypass the whitelist-based access control. Since UDP is stateless an attacker capable of passively observing traffic can spoof arbitrary messages using the MAC/IP of an authenticated client. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.,8.1,CWE-290

CVE-2024-42090,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: fix deadlock in create_pinctrl() when handling -EPROBE_DEFER  In create_pinctrl() pinctrl_maps_mutex is acquired before calling add_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER create_pinctrl() calls pinctrl_free(). However pinctrl_free() attempts to acquire pinctrl_maps_mutex which is already held by create_pinctrl() leading to a potential deadlock.  This patch resolves the issue by releasing pinctrl_maps_mutex before calling pinctrl_free() preventing the deadlock.  This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys Inc.,5.5,CWE-667
