CVE-2024-35843,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Use device rbtree in iopf reporting path  The existing I/O page fault handler currently locates the PCI device by calling pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). This function searches the list of all PCI devices until the desired device is found. To improve lookup efficiency replace it with device_rbtree_find() to search the device within the probed device rbtree.  The I/O page fault is initiated by the device which does not have any synchronization mechanism with the software to ensure that the device stays in the probed device tree. Theoretically a device could be released by the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and before iopf_get_dev_fault_param() which would cause a use-after-free problem.  Add a mutex to synchronize the I/O page fault reporting path and the IOMMU release device path. This lock doesn't introduce any performance overhead as the conflict between I/O page fault reporting and device releasing is very rare.,6.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-28255,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-35846,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory  Christian reports a NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap shrinker.  The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1] and the Red Hat bugzilla [2].  The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag the zswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL.  This is okay in many places like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in memcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of cgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.  Nhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case and I was then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.
