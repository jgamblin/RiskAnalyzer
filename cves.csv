CVE-2022-39248,matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow for example to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.,8.6,CWE-287

CVE-2024-39476,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid5: fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING  Xiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with small possibility the root cause is exactly the same as commit bed9e27baf52 (Revert md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d)  However Dan reported another hang after that and junxiao investigated the problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio can't issue from raid5d().  Current implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence:  1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold 'reconfig_mutex' to clear    MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING; 2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop until all IO are issued; 3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;  This behaviour is introduce before v2.6 and for consequence if other context hold 'reconfig_mutex' and md_check_recovery() can't update super_block then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop until 'reconfig_mutex' is released.  Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10 fix this problem by skipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after md_check_recovery() daemon thread will be woken up when 'reconfig_mutex' is released. Meanwhile the hang problem will be fixed as well.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-23206,The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. Users who use IAM OIDC custom resource provider package will download CA Thumbprints as part of the custom resource workflow. However the current `tls.connect` method will always set `rejectUnauthorized: false` which is a potential security concern. CDK should follow the best practice and set `rejectUnauthorized: true`. However this could be a breaking change for existing CDK applications and we should fix this with a feature flag. Note that this is marked as low severity Security advisory because the issuer url is provided by CDK users who define the CDK application. If they insist on connecting to a unauthorized OIDC provider CDK should not disallow this. Additionally the code block is run in a Lambda environment which mitigate the MITM attack. The patch is in progress. To mitigate upgrade to CDK v2.177.0 (Expected release date 2025-02-22). Once upgraded users should make sure the feature flag '@aws-cdk/aws-iam:oidcRejectUnauthorizedConnections' is set to true in `cdk.context.json` or `cdk.json`.
