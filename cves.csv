CVE-2024-47606,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result only 0x89 bytes are allocated despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally during the call to gst_memory_unmap the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.,9.8,CWE-190

CVE-2024-6538,A flaw was found in OpenShift Console. A Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack can happen if an attacker supplies all or part of a URL to the server to query. The server is considered to be in a privileged network position and can often reach exposed services that aren't readily available to clients due to network filtering. Leveraging such an attack vector the attacker can have an impact on other services and potentially disclose information or have other nefarious effects on the system. The /api/dev-console/proxy/internet endpoint on the OpenShit Console allows authenticated users to have the console's pod perform arbitrary and fully controlled HTTP(s) requests. The full response to these requests is returned by the endpoint. While the name of this endpoint suggests the requests are only bound to the internet no such checks are in place. An authenticated user can therefore ask the console to perform arbitrary HTTP requests from outside the cluster to a service inside the cluster.,5.3,CWE-918

CVE-2024-35895,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem  syzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes elements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be invoked from any interrupt context locks taken during a map_delete_elem operation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion is possible as reported by lockdep:         CPU0                    CPU1        ----                    ----   lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);                                local_irq_disable();                                lock(&host->lock);                                lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);   <Interrupt>     lock(&host->lock);  Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be deleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts enabled or in softirq context.  Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is _not_ hardirq-unsafe that is interrupts are disabled and bail out with an error.
