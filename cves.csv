CVE-2024-42131,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: avoid overflows in dirty throttling logic  The dirty throttling logic is interspersed with assumptions that dirty limits in PAGE_SIZE units fit into 32-bit (so that various multiplications fit into 64-bits).  If limits end up being larger we will hit overflows possible divisions by 0 etc.  Fix these problems by never allowing so large dirty limits as they have dubious practical value anyway.  For dirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to set so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory which can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirty limits from ratios to numbers of pages we just don't allow the result to exceed UINT_MAX.  This is root-only triggerable problem which occurs when the operator sets dirty limits to >16 TB.,4.4,CWE-190
CVE-2024-11725,The SMS Alert Order Notifications – WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the updateWcWarrantySettings() function in all versions up to and including 3.7.6.

CVE-2024-32864,Under certain circumstances exacqVision Web Services will not enforce secure web communications (HTTPS),6.4,CWE-319
CVE-2023-29510,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In XWiki every user can add translations that are only applied to the current user. This also allows overriding existing translations. Such translations are often included in privileged contexts without any escaping which allows remote code execution for any user who has edit access on at least one document which could be the user's own profile where edit access is enabled by default. A mitigation for this vulnerability is part of XWiki 14.10.2 and XWiki 15.0 RC1: translations with user scope now require script right. This means that regular users cannot exploit this anymore as users don't have script right by default anymore starting with XWiki 14.10. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a patched versions.,9.9,CWE-74
CVE-2023-50916,Kyocera Device Manager before 3.1.1213.0 allows NTLM credential exposure during UNC path authentication via a crafted change from a local path to a UNC path. It allows administrators to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \ (backslash) character which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy or sending the request directly to the application endpoint allows UNC paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the environment this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.,7.2,CWE-22
CVE-2023-24534,HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory even when parsing small inputs potentially leading to a denial of service. Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior to cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small request potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service. With fix header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.,7.5,CWE-400
CVE-2023-25988,Missing Authorization vulnerability in Video Gallery by Total-Soft Video Gallery – YouTube Gallery allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects Video Gallery – YouTube Gallery: from n/a through 1.7.6.,7.5,CWE-862

CVE-2023-41335,Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. When users update their passwords the new credentials may be briefly held in the server database.

CVE-2024-46695,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  selinuxsmack: don't bypass permissions check in inode_setsecctx hook  Marek Gresko reports that the root user on an NFS client is able to change the security labels on files on an NFS filesystem that is exported with root squashing enabled.  The end of the kerneldoc comment for __vfs_setxattr_noperm() states:   *  This function requires the caller to lock the inode's i_mutex before it  *  is executed. It also assumes that the caller will make the appropriate  *  permission checks.  nfsd_setattr() does do permissions checking via fh_verify() and nfsd_permission() but those don't do all the same permissions checks that are done by security_inode_setxattr() and its related LSM hooks do.  Since nfsd_setattr() is the only consumer of security_inode_setsecctx() simplest solution appears to be to replace the call to __vfs_setxattr_noperm() with a call to __vfs_setxattr_locked().  This fixes the above issue and has the added benefit of causing nfsd to recall conflicting delegations on a file when a client tries to change its security label.,4.4,CWE-276

CVE-2025-23028,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. A denial of service vulnerability affects versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7 1.15.0 through 1.15.11 and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4. In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS traffic an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads from outside the cluster. For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads that have DNS-based policy configured existing connections may continue to operate and new connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established but new connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to restart. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18 v1.15.12 and v1.16.5.
