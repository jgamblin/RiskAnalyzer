CVE-2023-45671,Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3 there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the `/<camera_name>` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch for this issue.,4.7,CWE-79

CVE-2023-27495,@fastify/csrf-protection is a plugin which helps protect Fastify servers against CSRF attacks. The CSRF protection enforced by the @fastify/csrf-protection library in combination with @fastify/cookie can be bypassed from network and same-site attackers under certain conditions. @fastify/csrf-protection supports an optional userInfo parameter that binds the CSRF token to the user. This parameter has been introduced to prevent cookie-tossing attacks as a fix for CVE-2021-29624. Whenever userInfo parameter is missing or its value can be predicted for the target user account network and same-site attackers can 1. fixate a _csrf cookie in the victim's browser and 2. forge CSRF tokens that are valid for the victim's session. This allows attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism. As a fix @fastify/csrf-protection starting from version 6.3.0 (and v4.1.0) includes a server-defined secret hmacKey that cryptographically binds the CSRF token to the value of the _csrf cookie and the userInfo parameter making tokens non-spoofable by attackers. This protection is effective as long as the userInfo parameter is unique for each user. This is patched in versions 6.3.0 and v4.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use a random non-predictable userInfo parameter for each user as a mitigation.,5.3,CWE-352

CVE-2021-1440,A vulnerability in the implementation of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) feature of Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) process to crash resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of a specific RPKI to Router (RTR) Protocol packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by compromising the RPKI validator server and sending a specifically crafted RTR packet to an affected device. Alternatively the attacker could use man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate the RPKI validator server and send a specifically crafted RTR response packet over the established RTR TCP connection to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition because the BGP process could constantly restart and BGP routing could become unstable.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This advisory is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

CVE-2022-23645,swtpm is a libtpms-based TPM emulator with socket character device and Linux CUSE interface. Versions prior to 0.5.3 0.6.2 and 0.7.1 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted header of swtpm's state where the blobheader's hdrsize indicator has an invalid value may cause an out-of-bounds access when the byte array representing the state of the TPM is accessed. This will likely crash swtpm or prevent it from starting since the state cannot be understood. Users should upgrade to swtpm v0.5.3 v0.6.2 or v0.7.1 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.,6.2,CWE-125
