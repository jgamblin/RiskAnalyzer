CVE-2024-49856,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/sgx: Fix deadlock in SGX NUMA node search  When the current node doesn't have an EPC section configured by firmware and all other EPC sections are used up CPU can get stuck inside the while loop that looks for an available EPC page from remote nodes indefinitely leading to a soft lockup. Note how nid_of_current will never be equal to nid in that while loop because nid_of_current is not set in sgx_numa_mask.  Also worth mentioning is that it's perfectly fine for the firmware not to setup an EPC section on a node. While setting up an EPC section on each node can enhance performance it is not a requirement for functionality.  Rework the loop to start and end on *a* node that has SGX memory. This avoids the deadlock looking for the current SGX-lacking node to show up in the loop when it never will.,5.5,CWE-835

CVE-2024-32465,Git is a revision control system. The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository it should not be trusted by default to be safe as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1 2.44.1 2.43.4 2.42.2 2.41.1 2.40.2 and 2.39.4. As a workaround avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained via archives from untrusted sources.,7.3,CWE-22

CVE-2024-26885,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix DEVMAP_HASH overflow check on 32-bit arches  The devmap code allocates a number hash buckets equal to the next power of two of the max_entries value provided when creating the map. When rounding up to the next power of two the 32-bit variable storing the number of buckets can overflow and the code checks for overflow by checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However on 32-bit arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through because it ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the size of an unsigned long is four bytes this is undefined behaviour so there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at the end.  Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it. Fix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up operation.,7.8,CWE-119

CVE-2025-32798,Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.4.0 the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result the integrity of the build environment is compromised and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.,9.8,CWE-94

CVE-2024-56712,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  udmabuf: fix memory leak on last export_udmabuf() error path  In export_udmabuf() if dma_buf_fd() fails because the FD table is full a dma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created; but the error handling in udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything about the containing dma_buf.  This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer; though that doesn't seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak.  Fix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we can give it different error handling.  Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21 (udmabuf: convert udmabuf driver to use folios); but the memory leak seems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2025-23031,WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `adicionar_alergia.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `nome` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `adicionar_alergia.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2023-36672,An issue was discovered in the Clario VPN client through 5.9.1.1662 for macOS. The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that traffic to the local network is sent in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel even if the local network is using a non-RFC1918 IP subnet. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into sending arbitrary IP traffic in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to LocalNet attack resulting in leakage of traffic in plaintext rather than to only Clario.,5.7,CWE-319
CVE-2023-41046,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible in XWiki to execute Velocity code without having script right by creating an XClass with a property of type TextArea and content type VelocityCode or VelocityWiki. For the former the syntax of the document needs to be set the `xwiki/1.0` (this syntax doesn't need to be installed). In both cases when adding the property to an object the Velocity code is executed regardless of the rights of the author of the property (edit right is still required though). In both cases the code is executed with the correct context author so no privileged APIs can be accessed. However Velocity still grants access to otherwise inaccessible data and APIs that could allow further privilege escalation. At least for VelocityCode this behavior is most likely very old but only since XWiki 7.2 script right is a separate right before that version all users were allowed to execute Velocity and thus this was expected and not a security issue. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.10 and 15.4 RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.,6.3,CWE-862

CVE-2024-45389,Pagefind a fully static search library initializes its dynamic JavaScript and WebAssembly files relative to the location of the first script the user loads. This information is gathered by looking up the value of `document.currentScript.src`. Prior to Pagefind version 1.1.1 it is possible to clobber this lookup with otherwise benign HTML on the page. This will cause `document.currentScript.src` to resolve as an external domain which will then be used by Pagefind to load dependencies. This exploit would only work in the case that an attacker could inject HTML to a live hosted website. In these cases this would act as a way to escalate the privilege available to an attacker. This assumes they have the ability to add some elements to the page (for example `img` tags with a `name` attribute) but not others as adding a `script` to the page would itself be the cross-site scripting vector. Pagefind has tightened this resolution in version 1.1.1 by ensuring the source is loaded from a valid script element. There are no reports of this being exploited in the wild via Pagefind.,6.4,CWE-79
