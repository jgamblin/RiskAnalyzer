CVE-2023-53091,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: update s_journal_inum if it changes after journal replay  When mounting a crafted ext4 image s_journal_inum may change after journal replay which is obviously unreasonable because we have successfully loaded and replayed the journal through the old s_journal_inum. And the new s_journal_inum bypasses some of the checks in ext4_get_journal() which may trigger a null pointer dereference problem.

CVE-2024-47084,Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability is related to **CORS origin validation** where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attacker’s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially attackers can upload files steal authentication tokens and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround users can manually enforce stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.,8.3,CWE-285

CVE-2025-27137,Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6 users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka Alert) and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself and highly discouraged.,4.4,CWE-73

CVE-2024-27038,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: Fix clk_core_get NULL dereference  It is possible for clk_core_get to dereference a NULL in the following sequence:  clk_core_get()     of_clk_get_hw_from_clkspec()         __of_clk_get_hw_from_provider()             __clk_get_hw()  __clk_get_hw() can return NULL which is dereferenced by clk_core_get() at hw->core.  Prior to commit dde4eff47c82 (clk: Look for parents with clkdev based clk_lookups) the check IS_ERR_OR_NULL() was performed which would have caught the NULL.  Reading the description of this function it talks about returning NULL but that cannot be so at the moment.  Update the function to check for hw before dereferencing it and return NULL if hw is NULL.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-49930,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath11k: fix array out-of-bound access in SoC stats  Currently the ath11k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error array is defined with a maximum size of DP_REO_DST_RING_MAX. However the ath11k_dp_process_rx() function access ath11k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error using the REO destination SRNG ring ID which is incorrect. SRNG ring ID differ from normal ring ID and this usage leads to out-of-bounds array access. To fix this issue modify ath11k_dp_process_rx() to use the normal ring ID directly instead of the SRNG ring ID to avoid out-of-bounds array access.

CVE-2023-25563,GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0 multiple out-of-bounds reads when decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of service. A 32-bit integer overflow condition can lead to incorrect checks of consistency of length of internal buffers. Although most applications will error out before accepting a singe input buffer of 4GB in length this could theoretically happen. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the application allows tokens greater than 4GB in length. This can lead to a large up to 65KB out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-service if it reads from unmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch for the out-of-bounds reads.,5.9,CWE-125

CVE-2025-27112,Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Starting in version 0.52.0 and prior to version 0.54.5 in certain Subsonic API endpoints a flaw in the authentication check process allows an attacker to specify any arbitrary username that does not exist on the system along with a salted hash of an empty password. Under these conditions Navidrome treats the request as authenticated granting access to various Subsonic endpoints without requiring valid credentials. An attacker can use any non-existent username to bypass the authentication system and gain access to various read-only data in Navidrome such as user playlists. However any attempt to modify data fails with a permission denied error due to insufficient permissions limiting the impact to unauthorized viewing of information. Version 0.54.5 contains a patch for this issue.,6.5,CWE-287

CVE-2021-47199,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: CT Fix multiple allocations and memleak of mod acts  CT clear action offload adds additional mod hdr actions to the flow's original mod actions in order to clear the registers which hold ct_state. When such flow also includes encap action a neigh update event can cause the driver to unoffload the flow and then reoffload it.  Each time this happens the ct clear handling adds that same set of mod hdr actions to reset ct_state until the max of mod hdr actions is reached.  Also the driver never releases the allocated mod hdr actions and causing a memleak.  Fix above two issues by moving CT clear mod acts allocation into the parsing actions phase and only use it when offloading the rule.

CVE-2024-35247,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fpga: region: add owner module and take its refcount  The current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-level module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region during programming if the parent device does not have a driver.  To address this problem add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for registering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper macros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.  Also update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface for registering an fpga region.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-62511,yt-grabber-tui is a C++ terminal user interface application for downloading YouTube content. yt-grabber-tui version 1.0 contains a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition (CWE-367) in the creation of the default configuration file config.json. In version 1.0 load_json_settings in Settings.hpp checks for the existence of config.json using boost::filesystem::exists and if the file is missing calls create_json_settings which writes the JSON configuration with boost::property_tree::write_json. A local attacker with write access to the application’s configuration directory (~/.config/yt-grabber-tui on Linux or the current working directory on Windows) can create a symbolic link between the existence check and the subsequent write so that the write operation follows the symlink and overwrites an attacker-chosen file accessible to the running process. This enables arbitrary file overwrite within the privileges of the application process which can corrupt files and cause loss of application or user data. If the application is executed with elevated privileges this could extend to system file corruption. The issue is fixed in version 1.0.1.,6.3,CWE-367
