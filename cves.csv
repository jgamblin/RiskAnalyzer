CVE-2022-48950,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf: Fix perf_pending_task() UaF  Per syzbot it is possible for perf_pending_task() to run after the event is free()'d. There are two related but distinct cases:   - the task_work was already queued before destroying the event;  - destroying the event itself queues the task_work.  The first cannot be solved using task_work_cancel() since perf_release() itself might be called from a task_work (____fput) which means the current->task_works list is already empty and task_work_cancel() won't be able to find the perf_pending_task() entry.  The simplest alternative is extending the perf_event lifetime to cover the task_work.  The second is just silly queueing a task_work while you know the event is going away makes no sense and is easily avoided by re-arranging how the event is marked STATE_DEAD and ensuring it goes through STATE_OFF on the way down.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-34241,OpenPrinting CUPS is a standards-based open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.6 CUPS logs data of free memory to the logging service AFTER the connection has been closed when it should have logged the data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.  The exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con->http)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always provided its argument is not null frees the pointer at the end of the call only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.

CVE-2022-48790,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme: fix a possible use-after-free in controller reset during load  Unlike .queue_rq in .submit_async_event drivers may not check the ctrl readiness for AER submission. This may lead to a use-after-free condition that was observed with nvme-tcp.  The race condition may happen in the following scenario: 1. driver executes its reset_ctrl_work 2. -> nvme_stop_ctrl - flushes ctrl async_event_work 3. ctrl sends AEN which is received by the host which in turn    schedules AEN handling 4. teardown admin queue (which releases the queue socket) 5. AEN processed submits another AER calling the driver to submit 6. driver attempts to send the cmd ==> use-after-free  In order to fix that add ctrl state check to validate the ctrl is actually able to accept the AER submission.  This addresses the above race in controller resets because the driver during teardown should: 1. change ctrl state to RESETTING 2. flush async_event_work (as well as other async work elements)  So after 12 any other AER command will find the ctrl state to be RESETTING and bail out without submitting the AER.,7.0,CWE-416

CVE-2021-47281,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()  The timer instance per queue is exclusive and snd_seq_timer_open() should have managed the concurrent accesses.  It looks as if it's checking the already existing timer instance at the beginning but it's not right because there is no protection hence any later concurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timer instance easily.  This may result in UAF as the leftover timer instance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed as spotted by syzkaller recently.  For avoiding the race add a proper check at the assignment of tmr->timeri again and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.,7.0,CWE-416

CVE-2023-39347,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. An attacker with the ability to update pod labels can cause Cilium to apply incorrect network policies. This issue arises due to the fact that on pod update Cilium incorrectly uses user-provided pod labels to select the policies which apply to the workload in question. This can affect Cilium network policies that use the namespace service account or cluster constructs to restrict traffic Cilium clusterwide network policies that use Cilium namespace labels to select the Pod and Kubernetes network policies. Non-existent construct names can be provided which bypass all network policies applicable to the construct. For example providing a pod with a non-existent namespace as the value of the `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` label results in none of the namespaced CiliumNetworkPolicies applying to the pod in question. This attack requires the attacker to have Kubernetes API Server access as described in the Cilium Threat Model. This issue has been resolved in: Cilium versions 1.14.2 1.13.7 and 1.12.14. Users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround an admission webhook can be used to prevent pod label updates to the `k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` and `io.cilium.k8s.policy.*` keys.,7.6,CWE-345
