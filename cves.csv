CVE-2024-21661,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13 2.9.9 and 2.10.4 an attacker can exploit a critical flaw in the application to initiate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack rendering the application inoperable and affecting all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an array in a multi-threaded environment. The vulnerability is rooted in the application's code where an array is being modified while it is being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes critically unsafe when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When two threads interact with the same array simultaneously the application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any attacker can crash the application continuously making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service. The issue is exacerbated because it does not require authentication widening the pool of potential attackers. Versions 2.8.13 2.9.9 and 2.10.4 contain a patch for this issue.,7.5,CWE-787

CVE-2025-23035,WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `adicionar_tipo_quadro_horario.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `tipo` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `adicionar_tipo_quadro_horario.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts which are then stored on the server.

CVE-2025-26619,Vega is a visualization grammar a declarative format for creating saving and sharing interactive visualization designs. In `vega` 5.30.0 and lower and in `vega-functions` 5.15.0 and lower  it was possible to call JavaScript functions from the Vega expression language that were not meant to be supported.

CVE-2024-29019,ESPHome is a system to control microcontrollers remotely through Home Automation systems. API endpoints in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation) are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) allowing remote attackers to carry out attacks against a logged user of the dashboard to perform operations on configuration files (create edit delete). It is possible for a malicious actor to create a specifically crafted web page that triggers a cross site request against ESPHome this allows bypassing the authentication for API calls on the platform. This vulnerability allows bypassing authentication on API calls accessing configuration file operations on the behalf of a logged user. In order to trigger the vulnerability the victim must visit a weaponized page.

CVE-2024-24823,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id even if for different user credentials. In this case the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an attack is high because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 and any versions of the 6.0 development branch contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists but is relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions` endpoint as that is the only one vulnerable.,5.7,CWE-384

CVE-2024-42131,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: avoid overflows in dirty throttling logic  The dirty throttling logic is interspersed with assumptions that dirty limits in PAGE_SIZE units fit into 32-bit (so that various multiplications fit into 64-bits).  If limits end up being larger we will hit overflows possible divisions by 0 etc.  Fix these problems by never allowing so large dirty limits as they have dubious practical value anyway.  For dirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to set so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory which can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirty limits from ratios to numbers of pages we just don't allow the result to exceed UINT_MAX.  This is root-only triggerable problem which occurs when the operator sets dirty limits to >16 TB.,4.4,CWE-190

CVE-2023-32007,** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might then be able to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution as the user Spark is currently running as. This issue was disclosed earlier as CVE-2022-33891 but incorrectly claimed version 3.1.3 (which has since gone EOL) would not be affected.  NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.  Users are recommended to upgrade to a supported version of Apache Spark such as version 3.4.0.,8.8,CWE-77

CVE-2024-26689,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: prevent use-after-free in encode_cap_msg()  In fs/ceph/caps.c in encode_cap_msg() use after free error was caught by KASAN at this line - 'ceph_buffer_get(arg->xattr_buf);'. This implies before the refcount could be increment here it was freed.  In same file in handle_cap_grant() refcount is decremented by this line - 'ceph_buffer_put(ci->i_xattrs.blob);'. It appears that a race occurred and resource was freed by the latter line before the former line could increment it.  encode_cap_msg() is called by __send_cap() and __send_cap() is called by ceph_check_caps() after calling __prep_cap(). __prep_cap() is where arg->xattr_buf is assigned to ci->i_xattrs.blob. This is the spot where the refcount must be increased to prevent use after free error.,7.8,CWE-416
