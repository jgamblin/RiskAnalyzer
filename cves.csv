CVE-2024-34359,llama-cpp-python is the Python bindings for llama.cpp. `llama-cpp-python` depends on class `Llama` in `llama.py` to load `.gguf` llama.cpp or Latency Machine Learning Models. The `__init__` constructor built in the `Llama` takes several parameters to configure the loading and running of the model. Other than `NUMA LoRa settings` `loading tokenizers` and `hardware settings` `__init__` also loads the `chat template` from targeted `.gguf` 's Metadata and furtherly parses it to `llama_chat_format.Jinja2ChatFormatter.to_chat_handler()` to construct the `self.chat_handler` for this model. Nevertheless `Jinja2ChatFormatter` parse the `chat template` within the Metadate with sandbox-less `jinja2.Environment` which is furthermore rendered in `__call__` to construct the `prompt` of interaction. This allows `jinja2` Server Side Template Injection which leads to remote code execution by a carefully constructed payload.,9.6,CWE-76

CVE-2024-47728,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Zero former ARG_PTR_TO_{LONGINT} args in case of error  For all non-tracing helpers which formerly had ARG_PTR_TO_{LONGINT} as input arguments zero the value for the case of an error as otherwise it could leak memory. For tracing it is not needed given CAP_PERFMON can already read all kernel memory anyway hence bpf_get_func_arg() and bpf_get_func_ret() is skipped in here.  Also the MTU helpers mtu_len pointer value is being written but also read. Technically the MEM_UNINIT should not be there in order to always force init. Removing MEM_UNINIT needs more verifier rework though: MEM_UNINIT right now implies two things actually: i) write into memory ii) memory does not have to be initialized. If we lift MEM_UNINIT it then becomes: i) read into memory ii) memory must be initialized. This means that for bpf_*_check_mtu() we're readding the issue we're trying to fix that is it would then be able to write back into things like .rodata BPF maps. Follow-up work will rework the MEM_UNINIT semantics such that the intent can be better expressed. For now just clear the *mtu_len on error path which can be lifted later again.,5.5,CWE-459

CVE-2025-25296,Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0 Label Studio's `/projects/upload-example` endpoint allows injection of arbitrary HTML through a `GET` request with an appropriately crafted `label_config` query parameter. By crafting a specially formatted XML label config with inline task data containing malicious HTML/JavaScript an attacker can achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). While the application has a Content Security Policy (CSP) it is only set in report-only mode making it ineffective at preventing script execution. The vulnerability exists because the upload-example endpoint renders user-provided HTML content without proper sanitization on a GET request. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers by getting them to visit a maliciously crafted URL. This is considered vulnerable because it enables attackers to execute JavaScript in victims' contexts potentially allowing theft of sensitive data session hijacking or other malicious actions. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2022-23521,Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanism to allow defining attributes for paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns a huge number of attributes for a single pattern or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file but not when parsing them from the index. Consequentially the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree the index or both. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes which may result in remote code execution.

CVE-2024-39496,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free due to race with dev replace  While loading a zone's info during creation of a block group we can race with a device replace operation and then trigger a use-after-free on the device that was just replaced (source device of the replace operation).  This happens because at btrfs_load_zone_info() we extract a device from the chunk map into a local variable and then use the device while not under the protection of the device replace rwsem. So if there's a device replace operation happening when we extract the device and that device is the source of the replace operation we will trigger a use-after-free if before we finish using the device the replace operation finishes and frees the device.  Fix this by enlarging the critical section under the protection of the device replace rwsem so that all uses of the device are done inside the critical section.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-49450,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix listen() setting the bar too high for the prealloc rings  AF_RXRPC's listen() handler lets you set the backlog up to 32 (if you bump up the sysctl) but whilst the preallocation circular buffers have 32 slots in them one of them has to be a dead slot because we're using CIRC_CNT().  This means that listen(rxrpc_sock 32) will cause an oops when the socket is closed because rxrpc_service_prealloc_one() allocated one too many calls and rxrpc_discard_prealloc() won't then be able to get rid of them because it'll think the ring is empty.  rxrpc_release_calls_on_socket() then tries to abort them but oopses because call->peer isn't yet set.  Fix this by setting the maximum backlog to RXRPC_BACKLOG_MAX - 1 to match the ring capacity.   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference address: 0000000000000086  ...
