CVE-2023-52754,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: imon: fix access to invalid resource for the second interface  imon driver probes two USB interfaces and at the probe of the second interface the driver assumes blindly that the first interface got bound with the same imon driver.  It's usually true but it's still possible that the first interface is bound with another driver via a malformed descriptor.  Then it may lead to a memory corruption as spotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata as struct imon_context object although it's a completely different one that was assigned by another driver.  This patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is really bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem above at the probe time.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-37155,OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9 the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace carriage return and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.,6.5,CWE-284

CVE-2024-34359,llama-cpp-python is the Python bindings for llama.cpp. `llama-cpp-python` depends on class `Llama` in `llama.py` to load `.gguf` llama.cpp or Latency Machine Learning Models. The `__init__` constructor built in the `Llama` takes several parameters to configure the loading and running of the model. Other than `NUMA LoRa settings` `loading tokenizers` and `hardware settings` `__init__` also loads the `chat template` from targeted `.gguf` 's Metadata and furtherly parses it to `llama_chat_format.Jinja2ChatFormatter.to_chat_handler()` to construct the `self.chat_handler` for this model. Nevertheless `Jinja2ChatFormatter` parse the `chat template` within the Metadate with sandbox-less `jinja2.Environment` which is furthermore rendered in `__call__` to construct the `prompt` of interaction. This allows `jinja2` Server Side Template Injection which leads to remote code execution by a carefully constructed payload.,9.6,CWE-76

CVE-2023-32681,Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0 Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.,6.1,CWE-200

CVE-2022-3602,A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

CVE-2024-26696,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()  Syzbot reported a hang issue in migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind() and nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2.  While migrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback to complete the log writer thread that should bring the writeback to completion picks up the folio being written back in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log creation and was trying to lock the folio.  Thus causing a deadlock.  In the first place it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of writeback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to verify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at mount so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is broken an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.  Investigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback completion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional and if the backing device does not require stable writes data may be modified without waiting.  Fix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to finish regardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-52494,Adacore Ada Web Server (AWS) before 25.2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to improper handling of SSL handshakes during connection initialization. When a client initiates an HTTPS connection the server performs the SSL handshake before assigning the connection to a processing slot. However there is no specific timeout set for this phase and the server uses the default socket timeout which is effectively infinite. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malformed TLS ClientHello message with incorrect length values. This causes the server to wait indefinitely for data that never arrives blocking the worker thread (Line) handling the connection. By opening multiple such connections up to the server's maximum limit the attacker can exhaust all available working threads preventing the server from handling new legitimate requests.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2022-50135,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/rxe: Fix BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in rxe_qp_do_cleanup  The function rxe_create_qp calls rxe_qp_from_init. If some error occurs the error handler of function rxe_qp_from_init will set both scq and rcq to NULL.  Then rxe_create_qp calls rxe_put to handle qp. In the end rxe_qp_do_cleanup is called by rxe_put. rxe_qp_do_cleanup directly accesses scq and rcq before checking them. This will cause null-ptr-deref error.  The call graph is as below:  rxe_create_qp {   ...   rxe_qp_from_init {     ...   err1:     ...     qp->rcq = NULL;  <---rcq is set to NULL     qp->scq = NULL;  <---scq is set to NULL     ...   }  qp_init:   rxe_put{     ...     rxe_qp_do_cleanup {       ...       atomic_dec(&qp->scq->num_wq); <--- scq is accessed       ...       atomic_dec(&qp->rcq->num_wq); <--- rcq is accessed     } },5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-37858,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation  The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 << l2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with >2TB aggregates on 32-bit systems) this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined behavior and improper AG sizing.  On 32-bit architectures: - Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow - This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in sbi->bmap->db_agsize - Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures - Could lead to:   - Filesystem corruption during extend operations   - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses   - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures  Fix by casting to s64 before shifting: bmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize;  This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in JFS block calculation code.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2023-34230,snowflake-connector-net the Snowflake Connector for .NET is vulnerable to command injection prior to version 2.0.18 via SSO URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue.,7.3,CWE-77

CVE-2024-56593,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: Fix oops due to NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw()  This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug in brcmfmac that occurs when a high 'sd_sgentry_align' value applies (e.g. 512) and a lot of queued SKBs are sent from the pkt queue.  The problem is the number of entries in the pre-allocated sgtable it is nents = max(rxglom_size txglom_size) + max(rxglom_size txglom_size) >> 4 + 1. Given the default [rt]xglom_size=32 it's actually 35 which is too small. Worst case the pkt queue can end up with 64 SKBs. This occurs when a new SKB is added for each original SKB if tailroom isn't enough to hold tail_pad. At least one sg entry is needed for each SKB. So eventually the skb_queue_walk loop in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw may run out of sg entries. This makes sg_next return NULL and this causes the oops.  The patch sets nents to max(rxglom_size txglom_size) * 2 to be able handle the worst-case. Btw. this requires only 64-35=29 * 16 (or 20 if CONFIG_NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH) = 464 additional bytes of memory.,5.5,CWE-476
