CVE-2023-52733,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/decompressor: specify __decompress() buf len to avoid overflow  Historically calls to __decompress() didn't specify out_len parameter on many architectures including s390 expecting that no writes beyond uncompressed kernel image are performed. This has changed since commit 2aa14b1ab2c4 (zstd: import usptream v1.5.2) which includes zstd library commit 6a7ede3dfccb (Reduce size of dctx by reutilizing dst buffer (#2751)). Now zstd decompression code might store literal buffer in the unwritten portion of the destination buffer. Since out_len is not set it is considered to be unlimited and hence free to use for optimization needs. On s390 this might corrupt initrd or ipl report which are often placed right after the decompressor buffer. Luckily the size of uncompressed kernel image is already known to the decompressor so to avoid the problem simply specify it in the out_len parameter.,7.8,CWE-120

CVE-2024-27309,While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.  Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug: 1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL 2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.  When those two preconditions are met Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal rather than the two or more that would be correct.  The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).  The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.,7.4,CWE-863
