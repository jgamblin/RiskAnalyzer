CVE-2023-27595,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. In version 1.13.0 when Cilium is started there is a short period when Cilium eBPF programs are not attached to the host. During this period the host does not implement any of Cilium's featureset. This can cause disruption to newly established connections during this period due to the lack of Load Balancing or can cause Network Policy bypass due to the lack of Network Policy enforcement during the window. This vulnerability impacts any Cilium-managed endpoints on the node (such as Kubernetes Pods) as well as the host network namespace (including Host Firewall). This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium 1.13.1 or later. Cilium releases 1.12.x 1.11.x and earlier are not affected. There are no known workarounds.,6.5,CWE-755
CVE-2025-32347,In onStart of BiometricEnrollIntroduction.java there is a possible way to determine the device's location due to an unsafe PendingIntent. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.,7.8,CWE-926
CVE-2021-47301,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igb: Fix use-after-free error during reset  Cleans the next descriptor to watch (next_to_watch) when cleaning the TX ring.

CVE-2024-22419,Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The `concat` built-in can write over the bounds of the memory buffer that was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid data. The root cause is that the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't properly adhere to the API of copy functions (for `>=0.3.2` the `copy_bytes` function). A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The buffer overflow can result in the change of semantics of the contract. The overflow is length-dependent and thus it might go unnoticed during contract testing. However certainly not all usages of concat will result in overwritten valid data as we require it to be in an internal function and close to the return statement where other memory allocations don't occur. This issue has been addressed in 0.4.0.,7.3,CWE-120
CVE-2025-0365,The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to and including 4.8.7 via the inline SVG feature.

This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.,4.4,CWE-79
CVE-2023-51651,AWS SDK for PHP is the Amazon Web Services software development kit for PHP. Within the scope of requests to S3 object keys and/or prefixes containing a Unix double-dot a URI path traversal is possible. The issue exists in the `buildEndpoint` method in the RestSerializer component of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 prior to 3.288.1. The `buildEndpoint` method relies on the Guzzle Psr7 UriResolver utility which strips dot segments from the request path in accordance with RFC 3986. Under certain conditions this could lead to an arbitrary object being accessed. This issue has been patched in version 3.288.1.,6.0,CWE-22
CVE-2023-30851,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.

CVE-2025-68134,EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0 the use of the `assert` function to handle errors frequently causes the module to crash. This is particularly critical because the manager shuts down all other modules and exits when any one of them terminates leading to a denial of service. In a context where a manager handles multiple EVSE this would also impact other users. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.,7.4,CWE-20

CVE-2023-44392,Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65 Garden has a dependency on the cryo library which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap` which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.,8.2,CWE-94

CVE-2022-23639,crossbeam-utils provides atomics synchronization primitives scoped threads and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust. crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that the alignment of `{iu}64` was always the same as `Atomic{IU}64`. However the alignment of `{iu}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{IU}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race.
