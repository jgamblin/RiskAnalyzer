CVE-2022-24731,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.5.0 but before versions 2.1.11 2.2.6 and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability allowing a malicious user with read/write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `create` or `update` access to Applications can leak the contents of any text file on the repo-server. By crafting a malicious Helm chart and using it in an Application the attacker can retrieve the sensitive file's contents either as part of the generated manifests or in an error message.

CVE-2025-37890,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc  As described in Gerrard's report [1] we have a UAF case when an hfsc class has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem duplicate case).  This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code won't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice catering for the reentrant case.

CVE-2024-35247,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fpga: region: add owner module and take its refcount  The current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-level module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region during programming if the parent device does not have a driver.  To address this problem add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for registering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper macros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.  Also update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface for registering an fpga region.,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2023-27479,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with view rights can execute arbitrary Groovy Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of UIX parameters. A proof of concept exploit is to log in add an `XWiki.UIExtensionClass` xobject to the user profile page with an Extension Parameters content containing `label={{/html}} {{async async=true cached=false context=doc.reference}}{{groovy}}println(Hello  + from groovy!){{/groovy}}{{/async}}`. Then navigating to `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` (i.e. `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/PanelsCode/ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` where `<xwiki-host>` is the URL of your XWiki installation) should not execute the Groovy script. If it does you will see `Hello from groovy!` displayed on the screen. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11 14.4.7 and 14.10-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade the issue can be fixed by editing the `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` wiki page and making the same modifications  as shown in commit `6de5442f3c`.,9.9,CWE-74

CVE-2023-29453,Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used since ES6 for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex and themselves can do string interpolation the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. var a = {{.}}) since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix Template. Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1 with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.,9.8,CWE-94

For this the attacker only needs to provide the reference to a PDF file to the macro. To obtain the reference of the desired attachment the attacker can access the Page Index Attachments tab. Even if the UI shows N/A the user can inspect the page and check the HTTP request that fetches the live data entries. The attachment URL is available in the returned JSON for all attachments including protected ones and allows getting the necessary values. This vulnerability is fixed in version 2.5.6.,7.5,CWE-615
