CVE-2025-47939,TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. By design the file management module in TYPO3’s backend user interface has historically allowed the upload of any file type with the exception of those that are directly executable in a web server context. This lack of restriction means it is possible to upload files that may be considered potentially harmful such as executable binaries (e.g. `.exe` files) or files with inconsistent file extensions and MIME types (for example a file incorrectly named with a `.png` extension but actually carrying the MIME type `application/zip`) starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.51 ELTS 10.4.50 ELTS 11.5.44 ELTS 12.4.31 LTS and 13.4.12 LTS. Although such files are not directly executable through the web server their presence can introduce indirect risks. For example third-party services such as antivirus scanners or malware detection systems might flag or block access to the website for end users if suspicious files are found. This could negatively affect the availability or reputation of the site.

CVE-2025-59139,Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. In versions prior to 4.9.7 a flaw in the `bodyLimit` middleware could allow bypassing the configured request body size limit when conflicting HTTP headers were present. The middleware previously prioritized the `Content-Length` header even when a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header was also included. According to the HTTP specification `Content-Length` must be ignored in such cases. This discrepancy could allow oversized request bodies to bypass the configured limit. Most standards-compliant runtimes and reverse proxies may reject such malformed requests with `400 Bad Request` so the practical impact depends on the runtime and deployment environment. If body size limits are used as a safeguard against large or malicious requests this flaw could allow attackers to send oversized request bodies. The primary risk is denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory or CPU consumption when handling very large requests. The implementation has been updated to align with the HTTP specification ensuring that `Transfer-Encoding` takes precedence over `Content-Length`. The issue is fixed in Hono v4.9.7 and all users should upgrade immediately.,5.3,CWE-400

CVE-2023-25149,TimescaleDB an open-source time-series SQL database has a privilege escalation vulnerability in versions 2.8.0 through 2.9.2. During installation TimescaleDB creates a telemetry job that is runs as the installation user. The queries run as part of the telemetry data collection were not run with a locked down `search_path` allowing malicious users to create functions that would be executed by the telemetry job leading to privilege escalation. In order to be able to take advantage of this vulnerability a user would need to be able to create objects in a database and then get a superuser to install TimescaleDB into their database. When TimescaleDB is installed as trusted extension non-superusers can install the extension without help from a superuser.  Version 2.9.3 fixes this issue. As a mitigation the `search_path` of the user running the telemetry job can be locked down to not include schemas writable by other users. The vulnerability is not exploitable on instances in Timescale Cloud and Managed Service for TimescaleDB due to additional security provisions in place on those platforms.,8.8,CWE-284
CVE-2024-39490,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: sr: fix missing sk_buff release in seg6_input_core  The seg6_input() function is responsible for adding the SRH into a packet delegating the operation to the seg6_input_core(). This function uses the skb_cow_head() to ensure that there is sufficient headroom in the sk_buff for accommodating the link-layer header. In the event that the skb_cow_header() function fails the seg6_input_core() catches the error but it does not release the sk_buff which will result in a memory leak.  This issue was introduced in commit af3b5158b89d (ipv6: sr: fix BUG due to headroom too small after SRH push) and persists even after commit 7a3f5b0de364 (netfilter: add netfilter hooks to SRv6 data plane) where the entire seg6_input() code was refactored to deal with netfilter hooks.  The proposed patch addresses the identified memory leak by requiring the seg6_input_core() function to release the sk_buff in the event that skb_cow_head() fails.,6.2,CWE-401

CVE-2025-27582,The Secure Password extension in One Identity Password Manager before 5.14.4 allows local privilege escalation. The issue arises from a flawed security hardening mechanism within the kiosk browser used to display the Password Self-Service site to end users. Specifically the application attempts to restrict privileged actions by overriding the native window.print() function. However this protection can be bypassed by an attacker who accesses the Password Self-Service site from the lock screen and navigates to an attacker-controlled webpage via the Help function. By hosting a crafted web page with JavaScript the attacker can restore and invoke the window.print() function launching a SYSTEM-privileged print dialog. From this dialog the attacker can exploit standard Windows functionality - such as the Print to PDF or Add Printer wizard - to spawn a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation allows a local attacker (with access to a locked workstation) to gain SYSTEM-level privileges granting full control over the affected device.,7.6,CWE-829

CVE-2022-24900,Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the malicious parameter represents an absolute path the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.,9.9,CWE-22
