CVE-2023-45143,Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client written from scratch for Node.js. Prior to version 5.26.2 Undici already cleared Authorization headers on cross-origin redirects but did not clear `Cookie` headers. By design `cookie` headers are forbidden request headers disallowing them to be set in RequestInit.headers in browser environments. Since undici handles headers more liberally than the spec there was a disconnect from the assumptions the spec made and undici's implementation of fetch. As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a third-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the third party site. This was patched in version 5.26.2. There are no known workarounds.,3.9,CWE-200

CVE-2022-29220,github-action-merge-dependabot is an action that automatically approves and merges dependabot pull requests (PRs). Prior to version 3.2.0 github-action-merge-dependabot does not check if a commit created by dependabot is verified with the proper GPG key. There is just a check if the actor is set to `dependabot[bot]` to determine if the PR is a legit PR. Theoretically an owner of a seemingly valid and legit action in the pipeline can check if the PR is created by dependabot and if their own action has enough permissions to modify the PR in the pipeline. If so they can modify the PR by adding a second seemingly valid and legit commit to the PR as they can set arbitrarily the username and email in for commits in git. Because the bot only checks if the actor is valid it would pass the malicious changes through and merge the PR automatically without getting noticed by project maintainers. It would probably not be possible to determine where the malicious commit came from as it would only say `dependabot[bot]` and the corresponding email-address. Version 3.2.0 contains a patch for this issue.,6.5,CWE-283

CVE-2022-48792,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task  Currently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upper layer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() or mpi_sata_completion().  In this case the following are the two steps in handling those I/O completions:   - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of    the I/O.   - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in    pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.  When complete() is called the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such we should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards but we do so in the pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.  Fix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-31457,gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin which separates the front and rear of the full stack. gin-vue-admin pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240407133540-7bc7c3051067 corresponding to version 2.6.1 has a code injection vulnerability in the backend. In the Plugin System -> Plugin Template feature an attacker can perform directory traversal by manipulating the `plugName` parameter. They can create specific folders such as `api` `config` `global` `model` `router` `service` and `main.go` function within the specified traversal directory. Moreover the Go files within these folders can have arbitrary code inserted based on a specific PoC parameter. The main reason for the existence of this vulnerability is the controllability of the PlugName field within the struct. Pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240409100909-b1b7427c6ea6 corresponding to commit b1b7427c6ea6c7a027fa188c6be557f3795e732b contains a patch for the issue.

CVE-2025-27789,Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers` and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.,6.2,CWE-1333

CVE-2024-31218,Webhood is a self-hosted URL scanner used analyzing phishing and malicious sites. Webhood's backend container images in versions 0.9.0 and earlier are subject to Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a HTTP request to the database (Pocketbase) admin API to create an admin account. The Pocketbase admin API does not check for authentication/authorization when creating an admin account when no admin accounts have been added. In its default deployment Webhood does not create a database admin account. Therefore unless users have manually created an admin account in the database an admin account will not exist in the deployment and the deployment is vulnerable. Versions starting from 0.9.1 are patched. The patch creates a randomly generated admin account if admin accounts have not already been created i.e. the vulnerability is exploitable in the deployment. As a workaround users can disable access to URL path starting with `/api/admins` entirely. With this workaround the vulnerability is not exploitable via network.,9.8,CWE-306

CVE-2024-55603,Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`) to store the session data in a database. Therefore when a `session_id` is given kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point it does not correctly verify if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus a session which's lifetime is already `> time()` is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function that does remove invalid sessions is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()` based on `session.gc_divisor` `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1 session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-613

CVE-2024-13899,The Mambo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to and including 1.0 via deserialization of untrusted input via the $data parameter in the fImportMenu function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Administrator-level access and above to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files retrieve sensitive data or execute code depending on the POP chain present.,7.2,CWE-502
CVE-2025-11465,Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt CO File Parsing Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CO files. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-26631.,7.8,CWE-416
CVE-2025-4517,Allows arbitrary filesystem writes outside the extraction directory during extraction with filter=data.   You are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall() or TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of data or tar. See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information.  Note that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from no filtering to `data so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.  Note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when evaluating source distributions it's important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.,9.4,CWE-22
CVE-2024-12880,A vulnerability in infiniflow/ragflow version RAGFlow-0.13.0 allows for partial account takeover via insecure data querying. The issue arises from the way tenant IDs are handled in the application.
