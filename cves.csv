CVE-2025-27154,Spotipy is a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. The `CacheHandler` class creates a cache file to store the auth token. Prior to version 2.25.1 the file created has `rw-r--r--` (644) permissions by default when it could be locked down to `rw-------` (600) permissions.

CVE-2022-41972,Contiki-NG is an open-source cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to 4.9 contain a NULL Pointer Dereference in BLE L2CAP module. The Contiki-NG operating system for IoT devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack. An attacker can inject a packet in this stack which causes the implementation to dereference a NULL pointer and triggers undefined behavior. More specifically while processing the L2CAP protocol the implementation maps an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. In this structure state information regarding credits is managed through calls to the function input_l2cap_credit in the module os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c. Unfortunately the input_l2cap_credit function does not check that the metadata corresponding to the user-supplied channel ID actually exists which can lead to the channel variable being set to NULL before a pointer dereferencing operation is performed. The vulnerability has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG and will be included in release 4.9. Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2253 as a workaround until the new package is released.,2.9,CWE-476
CVE-2024-1666,In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.0 an authorization flaw exists that allows unauthorized radar creation.

CVE-2025-32798,Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.4.0 the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result the integrity of the build environment is compromised and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations.

CVE-2023-34232,snowflake-connector-nodejs a NodeJS driver for Snowflake is vulnerable to command injection via single sign on (SSO) browser URL authentication in versions prior to 1.6.21. In order to exploit the potential for command injection an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 1.6.21 contains a patch for this issue.,7.3,CWE-77

CVE-2024-3848,A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.11.0 identified as a bypass for the previously addressed CVE-2023-6909. The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that when processed ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result an attacker can read arbitrary files including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path.

CVE-2022-4149,The Netskope client service (prior to R96) on Windows runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM which writes log files to a writable directory (C:\Users\Public\netSkope) for a standard user. The files are created and written with a SYSTEM account except one file (logplaceholder) which inherits permission giving all users full access control list. Netskope client restricts access to this file by allowing only read permissions as a standard user. Whenever the Netskope client service restarts it deletes the logplaceholder and recreates creating a race condition which can be exploited by a malicious local user to create the file and set ACL permissions on the file. Once the file is created by a malicious user with proper ACL permissions all files within C:\Users\Public\netSkope\ becomes modifiable by the unprivileged user. By using Windows pseudo-symlink these files can be pointed to other places in the system and thus malicious users will be able to elevate privileges. ,7.0,CWE-367

CVE-2024-45016,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netem: fix return value if duplicate enqueue fails  There is a bug in netem_enqueue() introduced by commit 5845f706388a (net: netem: fix skb length BUG_ON in __skb_to_sgvec) that can lead to a use-after-free.  This commit made netem_enqueue() always return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS when a packet is duplicated which can cause the parent qdisc's q.qlen to be mistakenly incremented. When this happens qlen_notify() may be skipped on the parent during destruction leaving a dangling pointer for some classful qdiscs like DRR.  There are two ways for the bug happen:  - If the duplicated packet is dropped by rootq->enqueue() and then   the original packet is also dropped. - If rootq->enqueue() sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc   and the original packet is dropped.  In both cases NET_XMIT_SUCCESS is returned even though no packets are enqueued at the netem qdisc.  The fix is to defer the enqueue of the duplicate packet until after the original packet has been guaranteed to return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS.,5.5,CWE-416

CVE-2024-40915,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: rewrite __kernel_map_pages() to fix sleeping in invalid context  __kernel_map_pages() is a debug function which clears the valid bit in page table entry for deallocated pages to detect illegal memory accesses to freed pages.  This function set/clear the valid bit using __set_memory(). __set_memory() acquires init_mm's semaphore and this operation may sleep. This is problematic because  __kernel_map_pages() can be called in atomic context and thus is illegal to sleep.

CVE-2024-36114,Aircompressor is a library with ports of the Snappy LZO LZ4 and Zstandard compression algorithms to Java. All decompressor implementations of Aircompressor (LZ4 LZO Snappy Zstandard) can crash the JVM for certain input and in some cases also leak the content of other memory of the Java process (which could contain sensitive information). When decompressing certain data the decompressors try to access memory outside the bounds of the given byte arrays or byte buffers. Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++ namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed. When decompressing data from untrusted users this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM or to leak other sensitive information from the Java process. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,8.6,CWE-125
