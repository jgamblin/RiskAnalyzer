CVE-2024-27933,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. In version 1.39.0 use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()` which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource the raw file descriptor is closed together.  Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.  This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed suppressing all prompt outputs.  Version 1.39.1 fixes the bug. ,8.2,CWE-863

CVE-2022-48784,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destruction  My previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race where the exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced below) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already runs while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking some interfaces as nl_owner_dead.  The race happens because we have two loops here - first we dev_close() all the netdevs and then we destroy them. If we also have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though) then we can find one during the first iteration close it and go to the second iteration -- but then find two and try to destroy also the one we didn't close yet.  Fix this by only iterating once.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2022-24778,The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4 a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.,7.5,CWE-863

This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when an ACL changes from inactive to active in the running configuration of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL. The reverse condition is also true—traffic that should be permitted could be denied by the configured ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting. Note: This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic as well as dual-stack ACL configurations in which both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are configured on an interface.,5.8,CWE-436
