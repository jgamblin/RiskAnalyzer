CVE-2023-32007,** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the application.

CVE-2022-23005,Western Digital has identified a weakness in the UFS standard that could result in a security vulnerability. This vulnerability may exist in some systems where the Host boot ROM code implements the UFS Boot feature to boot from UFS compliant storage devices. The UFS Boot feature as specified in the UFS standard is provided by UFS devices to support platforms that need to download the system boot loader from external non-volatile storage locations. Several scenarios have been identified in which adversaries may disable the boot capability or revert to an old boot loader code if the host boot ROM code is improperly implemented. UFS Host Boot ROM implementers may be impacted by this vulnerability. UFS devices are only impacted when connected to a vulnerable UFS Host and are not independently impacted by this vulnerability. When present the vulnerability is in the UFS Host implementation and is not a vulnerability in Western Digital UFS Devices. Western Digital has provided details of the vulnerability to the JEDEC standards body multiple vendors of host processors and software solutions providers.,8.7,CWE-1224

CVE-2022-29162,runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.,5.9,CWE-276

CVE-2025-4382,A flaw was found in systems utilizing LUKS-encrypted disks with GRUB configured for TPM-based auto-decryption. When GRUB is set to automatically decrypt disks using keys stored in the TPM it reads the decryption key into system memory. If an attacker with physical access can corrupt the underlying filesystem superblock GRUB will fail to locate a valid filesystem and enter rescue mode. At this point the disk is already decrypted and the decryption key remains loaded in system memory. This scenario may allow an attacker with physical access to access the unencrypted data without any further authentication thereby compromising data confidentiality. Furthermore the ability to force this state through filesystem corruption also presents a data integrity concern.,5.9,CWE-306

CVE-2024-39864,The CloudStack integration API service allows running its unauthenticated API server (usually on port 8096 when configured and enabled via integration.api.port global setting) for internal portal integrations and for testing purposes. By default the integration API service port is disabled and is considered disabled when integration.api.port is set to 0 or negative.

CVE-2024-45311,Quinn is a pure-Rust async-compatible implementation of the IETF QUIC transport protocol. As of quinn-proto 0.11 it is possible for a server to `accept()` `retry()` `refuse()` or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application while the latter is only theoretical.,7.5,CWE-670

CVE-2024-35997,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-up  The flag I2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations. However this is not necessary because I2C core already has its own locking for that.  More importantly this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set in i2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens the interrupt handler (i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doing anything then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in an infinite loop.  Since interrupt handler is an RT task it takes over the CPU and the flag-clearing task never gets scheduled thus we have a lock-up.  Delete this unnecessary flag.,5.5,CWE-667
