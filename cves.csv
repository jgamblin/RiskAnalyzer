CVE-2024-4680,A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.3 allows attackers to reuse old session credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session expiration. Specifically the session does not expire after a password change enabling an attacker to maintain access to a compromised account without the victim's ability to revoke this access. This issue was observed in a self-hosted ZenML deployment via Docker where after changing the password from one browser the session remained active and usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication.,8.8,CWE-613
CVE-2022-39231,Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In versions prior to 4.10.16 or from 5.0.0 to 5.2.6 validation of the authentication adapter app ID for _Facebook_ and _Spotify_ may be circumvented. Configurations which allow users to authenticate using the Parse Server authentication adapter where `appIds` is set as a string instead of an array of strings authenticate requests from an app with a different app ID than the one specified in the `appIds` configuration. For this vulnerability to be exploited an attacker needs to be assigned an app ID by the authentication provider which is a sub-set of the server-side configured app ID. This issue is patched in versions 4.10.16 and 5.2.7. There are no known workarounds.,3.7,CWE-287

CVE-2024-45030,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igb: cope with large MAX_SKB_FRAGS  Sabrina reports that the igb driver does not cope well with large MAX_SKB_FRAG values: setting MAX_SKB_FRAG to 45 causes payload corruption on TX.  An easy reproducer is to run ssh to connect to the machine.  With MAX_SKB_FRAGS=17 it works with MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45 it fails.  This has been reported originally in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265320  The root cause of the issue is that the driver does not take into account properly the (possibly large) shared info size when selecting the ring layout and will try to fit two packets inside the same 4K page even when the 1st fraglist will trump over the 2nd head.  Address the issue by checking if 2K buffers are insufficient.,5.5,CWE-787
CVE-2025-2680,A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul Bank Locker Management System 1.0. It has been declared as critical.

CVE-2023-46724,Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages.,8.6,CWE-125

CVE-2022-36062,Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions prior to 8.5.13 9.0.9 and 9.1.6 Grafana is subject to Improper Preservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation on some folders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability impacts Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards as the migrations which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBAC permissions do not account for the scenario where the only user permission in the folder is Admin as a result RBAC adds permissions for Editors and Viewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issue has been patched in versions 8.5.13 9.0.9 and 9.1.6. A workaround when the impacted folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additional permissions manually.,7.6,CWE-281

CVE-2024-45015,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dpu: move dpu_encoder's connector assignment to atomic_enable()  For cases where the crtc's connectors_changed was set without enable/active getting toggled  there is an atomic_enable() call followed by an atomic_disable() but without an atomic_mode_set().  This results in a NULL ptr access for the dpu_encoder_get_drm_fmt() call in the atomic_enable() as the dpu_encoder's connector was cleared in the atomic_disable() but not re-assigned as there was no atomic_mode_set() call.  Fix the NULL ptr access by moving the assignment for atomic_enable() and also use drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder() to get the connector from the atomic_state.

CVE-2024-45818,The hypervisor contains code to accelerate VGA memory accesses for HVM guests when the (virtual) VGA is in standard mode.  Locking involved there has an unusual discipline leaving a lock acquired past the return from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a problem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses both of which touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't relevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access the lock that is already being held would be attempted to be re-acquired resulting in a deadlock.  This deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced but was analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light of the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking discipline work.  In staging this logic has all been removed because it was discovered to be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore we are fixing the locking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note that even with the feature disabled the lock would still be acquired for any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.,6.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-37281,Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet-of-things devices. In versions 4.9 and prior when processing the various IPv6 header fields during IPHC header decompression Contiki-NG confirms the received packet buffer contains enough data as needed for that field. But no similar check is done before decompressing the IPv6 address. Therefore up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds on the line with the statement `memcpy(&ipaddr->u8[16 - postcount] iphc_ptr postcount);`. The value of `postcount` depends on the address compression used in the received packet and can be controlled by the attacker. As a result an attacker can inject a packet that causes an out-of-bound read. As of time of publication a patched version is not available. As a workaround one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2509 to patch the system.,5.3,CWE-125
