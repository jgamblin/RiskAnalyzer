CVE-2025-23037,WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `control.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `cargo` parameter.

CVE-2024-52811,The ngtcp2 project is an effort to implement IETF QUIC protocol in C. In affected versions acks are not validated before being written to the qlog leading to a buffer overflow. In `ngtcp2_conn::conn_recv_pkt` for an ACK there was new logic that got added to skip `conn_recv_ack` if an ack has already been processed in the payload. However this causes us to also skip `ngtcp2_pkt_validate_ack`. The ack which was skipped still got written to qlog. The bug occurs in `ngtcp2_qlog::write_ack_frame`. It is now possible to reach this code with an invalid ack suppose `largest_ack=0` and `first_ack_range=15`. Subtracting `largest_ack - first_ack_range` will lead to an integer underflow which is 20 chars long. However the ngtcp2 qlog code assumes the number written is a signed integer and only accounts for 19 characters of overhead (see `NGTCP2_QLOG_ACK_FRAME_RANGE_OVERHEAD`). Therefore we overwrite the buffer causing a heap overflow. This is high priority and could potentially impact many users if they enable qlog. qlog is disabled by default. Due to its overhead it is most likely used for debugging purpose but the actual use is unknown. ngtcp2 v1.9.1 fixes the bug and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not turn on qlog.,8.2,CWE-670

CVE-2024-26974,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat - resolve race condition during AER recovery  During the PCI AER system's error recovery process the kernel driver may encounter a race condition with freeing the reset_data structure's memory. If the device restart will take more than 10 seconds the function scheduling that restart will exit due to a timeout and the reset_data structure will be freed. However this data structure is used for completion notification after the restart is completed which leads to a UAF bug.  This results in a KFENCE bug notice.    BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read in adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]   Use-after-free read at 0x00000000bc56fddf (in kfence-#142):   adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]   process_one_work+0x173/0x340  To resolve this race condition the memory associated to the container of the work_struct is freed on the worker if the timeout expired otherwise on the function that schedules the worker. The timeout detection can be done by checking if the caller is still waiting for completion or not by using completion_done() function.,7.0,CWE-367
