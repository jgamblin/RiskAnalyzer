CVE-2024-53063,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access  The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.  The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set or not. When not set dvb_register_device() won't check for boundaries as it will rely that a previous call to dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.  On a similar way dvb_device_open() uses the assumption that the register functions already did the needed checks.  This can be fragile if some device ends using different calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers like Coverity.  So add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.,5.5,CWE-755
CVE-2022-2431,The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in versions up to and including 3.2.50. This is due to insufficient file type and path validation on the deleteFiles() function found in the ~/Admin/Menu/Packages.php file that triggers upon download post deletion. This makes it possible for contributor level users and above to supply an arbitrary file path via the 'file[files]' parameter when creating a download post and once the user deletes the post the supplied arbitrary file will be deleted. This can be used by attackers to delete the /wp-config.php file which will reset the installation and make it possible for an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server.,8.1,CWE-73

CVE-2025-47281,Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. In versions 1.14.1 and below a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g. {{@ | non_existent_function }}). This leads to a nil value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions specifically getValueAsStringMap which expect string values results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (interface {} is nil not string). This crashes Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod. This is fixed in version 1.14.2.,7.7,CWE-20

CVE-2025-38669,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert drm/gem-shmem: Use dma_buf from GEM object instance  This reverts commit 1a148af06000e545e714fe3210af3d77ff903c11.  The dma_buf field in struct drm_gem_object is not stable over the object instance's lifetime. The field becomes NULL when user space releases the final GEM handle on the buffer object. This resulted in a NULL-pointer deref.  Workarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 (drm/gem: Acquire references on GEM handles for framebuffers) and commit f6bfc9afc751 (drm/framebuffer: Acquire internal references on GEM handles) only solved the problem partially. They especially don't work for buffer objects without a DRM framebuffer associated.  Hence this revert to going back to using .import_attach->dmabuf.  v3: - cc stable,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-48309,NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth` applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor could create an empty/mock user by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state PKCE or nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This vulnerability does not give access to other users' data neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name email access_token etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability. As a workaround using a custom authorization callback for Middleware developers can manually do a basic authentication.,5.3,CWE-285

CVE-2024-27935,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3 a vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior. This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly. Version 1.36.3 contains a patch for this issue. ,7.2,CWE-488

This occurred even if the configuration schema specified that they should have backend or secret visibility. This was an intended feature of the APP_CONFIG_* way of supplying configuration but now clearly goes against the expected behavior of the configuration system. This behavior leads to a risk of potentially exposing sensitive configuration details intended to remain private or restricted to backend processes. The issue has been resolved in version 0.3.75 of the @backstage/plugin-app-backend package. As a temporary measure avoid supplying secrets using the APP_CONFIG_ configuration pattern. Consider alternative methods for setting secrets such as the environment substitution available for Backstage configuration.,5.8,CWE-440

CVE-2024-41942,JupyterHub is software that allows one to create a multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks. Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0 if a user is granted the `admin:users` scope they may escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user.

CVE-2022-2309,NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable for example and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function a crash can be triggered.,7.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-39384,OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0 initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation where reentrancy is not feasible so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround avoid untrusted external calls during initialization.,5.6,CWE-665

CVE-2022-39278,Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides traffic management policy enforcement and telemetry collection. Prior to versions 1.15.2 1.14.5 and 1.13.9 the Istio control plane istiod is vulnerable to a request processing error allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly.
