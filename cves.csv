CVE-2020-27784,A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel where accessing a deallocated instance in printer_ioctl() printer_ioctl() tries to access of a printer_dev instance. However use-after-free arises because it had been freed by gprinter_free().,5.5,CWE-201
CVE-2024-34077,MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker. Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account if the victim has an incomplete request pending. The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened and the user did not complete the process by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround one may mitigate the risk by reducing the verification token's validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in `constants_inc.php`).,7.3,CWE-305

CVE-2022-42320,Xenstore: Guests can get access to Xenstore nodes of deleted domains Access rights of Xenstore nodes are per domid. When a domain is gone there might be Xenstore nodes left with access rights containing the domid of the removed domain. This is normally no problem as those access right entries will be corrected when such a node is written later. There is a small time window when a new domain is created where the access rights of a past domain with the same domid as the new one will be regarded to be still valid leading to the new domain being able to get access to a node which was meant to be accessible by the removed domain. For this to happen another domain needs to write the node before the newly created domain is being introduced to Xenstore by dom0.,7.0,CWE-459

CVE-2025-25183,vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Maliciously constructed statements can lead to hash collisions resulting in cache reuse which can interfere with subsequent responses and cause unintended behavior. Prefix caching makes use of Python's built-in hash() function. As of Python 3.12 the behavior of hash(None) has changed to be a predictable constant value. This makes it more feasible that someone could try exploit hash collisions. The impact of a collision would be using cache that was generated using different content. Given knowledge of prompts in use and predictable hashing behavior someone could intentionally populate the cache using a prompt known to collide with another prompt in use. This issue has been addressed in version 0.7.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,2.6,CWE-354
