CVE-2025-64484,OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions prior to 7.13.0 all deployments of OAuth2 Proxy in front of applications that normalize underscores to dashes in HTTP headers (e.g. WSGI-based frameworks such as Django Flask FastAPI and PHP applications). Authenticated users can inject underscore variants of X-Forwarded-* headers that bypass the proxy’s filtering logic potentially escalating privileges in the upstream app. OAuth2 Proxy authentication/authorization itself is not compromised. The problem has been patched with v7.13.0. By default all specified headers will now be normalized meaning that both capitalization and the use of underscores (_) versus dashes (-) will be ignored when matching headers to be stripped. For example both `X-Forwarded-For` and `X_Forwarded-for` will now be treated as equivalent and stripped away. For those who have a rational that requires keeping a similar looking header and not stripping it the maintainers introduced a new configuration field for Headers managed through the AlphaConfig called `InsecureSkipHeaderNormalization`. As a workaround ensure filtering and processing logic in upstream services don't treat underscores and hyphens in Headers the same way.,8.5,CWE-644

CVE-2023-40176,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can exploit a stored XSS through their user profile by setting the payload as the value of the time zone user preference. Even though the time zone is selected from a drop down (no free text value) it can still be set from JavaScript (using the browser developer tools) or by calling the save URL on the user profile with the right query string. Once the time zone is set it is displayed without escaping which means the payload gets executed for any user that visits the malicious user profile allowing the attacker to steal information and even gain more access rights (escalation to programming rights). This issue is present since version 4.1M2 when the time zone user preference was introduced. The issue has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1.,9.0,CWE-79

CVE-2025-38290,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: fix node corruption in ar->arvifs list  In current WLAN recovery code flow ath12k_core_halt() only reinitializes the arvifs list head. This will cause the list node immediately following the list head to become an invalid list node. Because the prev of that node still points to the list head arvifs but the next of the list head arvifs no longer points to that list node.  When a WLAN recovery occurs during the execution of a vif removal and it happens before the spin_lock_bh(&ar->data_lock) in ath12k_mac_vdev_delete() list_del() will detect the previously mentioned situation thereby triggering a kernel panic.  The fix is to remove and reinitialize all vif list nodes from the list head arvifs during WLAN halt. The reinitialization is to make the list nodes valid ensuring that the list_del() in ath12k_mac_vdev_delete() can execute normally.  Call trace: __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0xd4/0x100 (P) ath12k_mac_remove_link_interface.isra.0+0xf8/0x2e4 [ath12k] ath12k_scan_vdev_clean_work+0x40/0x164 [ath12k] cfg80211_wiphy_work+0xfc/0x100 process_one_work+0x164/0x2d0 worker_thread+0x254/0x380 kthread+0xfc/0x100 ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20  The change is mostly copied from the ath11k patch: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250320053145.3445187-1-quic_stonez@quicinc.com/  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1,5.5,CWE-362

This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary SQL payloads and bypass authentication gaining unauthorized administrative access. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplies specially crafted input in the username field such as ' OR '1'='1 leading to complete compromise of the login mechanism and potential exposure of sensitive backend data.,9.8,CWE-89
CVE-2022-49779,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kprobes: Skip clearing aggrprobe's post_handler in kprobe-on-ftrace case  In __unregister_kprobe_top() if the currently unregistered probe has post_handler but other child probes of the aggrprobe do not have post_handler the post_handler of the aggrprobe is cleared.

CVE-2025-6264,Velociraptor allows collection of VQL queries packaged into Artifacts from endpoints. These artifacts can be used to do anything and usually run with elevated permissions.  To limit access to some dangerous artifact Velociraptor allows for those to require high permissions like EXECVE to launch.

CVE-2024-56755,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING  In fscache_create_volume() there is a missing memory barrier between the bit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause a situation where after a wake-up the bit-clearing operation hasn't been detected yet leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is as follows:    [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work] fscache_perform_lookup   fscache_create_volume                         fscache_perform_lookup                           fscache_create_volume 			                        fscache_create_volume_work                                                   cachefiles_acquire_volume                                                   clear_and_wake_up_bit     test_and_set_bit                             test_and_set_bit                               goto maybe_wait       goto no_wait  In the above process cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1 enters the -no_wait- process it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting process. If a barrier is missing it may cause cookie2 to remain in the -wait- process indefinitely.  In commit 3288666c7256 (fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in fscache_create_volume_work()) barriers were added to similar operations in fscache_create_volume_work() but fscache_create_volume() was missed.  By combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to fix this issue.,5.5,CWE-401
