CVE-2024-49760,OpenRefine is a free open source tool for working with messy data. The load-language command expects a `lang` parameter from which it constructs the path of the localization file to load of the form `translations-$LANG.json`. But when doing so in versions prior to 3.8.3 it does not check that the resulting path is in the expected directory which means that this command could be exploited to read other JSON files on the file system.

CVE-2024-50196,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts  The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.  ``` for (i = 0; i < info->stride; i++) { 	uregmap_read(info->map id_reg + 4 * i &reg); 	if (!reg) 		continue;  	chained_irq_enter(parent_chip desc); ```  However in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent controller configured in edge mode GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the hardware. In the result if the interrupt is short enough the parent interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared; chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to service the parent interrupt.  Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the hardware.  The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions wrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers: ``` grep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl ```,5.5,CWE-754

CVE-2025-31491,AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create deploy and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1 AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default) any redirect is not followed by the initial request but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/) and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked. This allows leaking auth headers and private cookies. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.,8.6,CWE-200

CVE-2024-25117,php-svg-lib is a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file parsing/rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.2 php-svg-lib fails to validate that font-family doesn't contain a PHAR url which might leads to RCE on PHP < 8.0 and doesn't validate if external references are allowed. This might leads to bypass of restrictions or RCE on projects that are using it if they do not strictly revalidate the fontName that is passed by php-svg-lib. The `Style::fromAttributes(`) or the `Style::parseCssStyle()` should check the content of the `font-family` and prevents it to use a PHAR url to avoid passing an invalid and dangerous `fontName` value to other libraries. The same check as done in the `Style::fromStyleSheets` might be reused. Libraries using this library as a dependency might be vulnerable to some bypass of restrictions or even remote code execution if they do not double check the value of the `fontName` that is passed by php-svg-lib. Version 0.5.2 contains a fix for this issue.,6.8,CWE-73

This issue can result in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination of the redirect potentially leading to a successful phishing attack or other types of attacks.    Once a crafted URL is made it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via email for example. This will trigger this vulnerability when the user visits the page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can use this to target users they know are Keycloak admins for further attacks. It may also be possible to bypass other domain-related security checks such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri. The malicious actor can further obfuscate the redirect_uri using URL encoding to hide the text of the actual malicious website domain.,6.1,CWE-601

CVE-2022-48809,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata  When uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata a new dst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb. This is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specific skb.  The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of 1 which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. When tun_dst_unclone returns the dst+metadata is only referenced from a single place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never drop to 0 (when the skb is consumed) leading to a memory leak.  Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone as the dst+metadata refcount is already 1.,5.5,CWE-401
