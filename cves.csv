CVE-2024-49982,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places  For fixing CVE-2023-6270 f98364e92662 (aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts) makes tx() calling dev_put() instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs into use-after-free.  Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate() aoecmd_ata_rw() resend() probe() and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the refcnt of skb->dev.  On the other hand moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of skb->dev be reduced to a negative value because corresponding dev_hold() are not called in revalidate() aoecmd_ata_rw() resend() probe() and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). This patch fixed this issue.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-49298,OpenZFS through 2.1.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.1 in certain scenarios involving applications that try to rely on efficient copying of file data can replace file contents with zero-valued bytes and thus potentially disable security mechanisms. NOTE: this issue is not always security related but can be security related in realistic situations. A possible example is cp from a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version when attempting to preserve a rule set for denying unauthorized access. (One might use cp when configuring access control such as with the /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.) NOTE: this issue occurs less often in version 2.2.1 and in versions before 2.1.4 because of the default configuration in those versions.,7.5,CWE-639

CVE-2022-20870,A vulnerability in the egress MPLS packet processing function of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 3650 Catalyst 3850 and Catalyst 9000 Family Switches could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of IPv4 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed packet out of an affected MPLS-enabled interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload resulting in a DoS condition.,8.6,CWE-130
