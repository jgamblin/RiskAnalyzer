CVE-2023-37898,Joplin is a free open source note taking and to-do application. A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an untrusted note opened in safe mode to execute arbitrary code. `packages/renderer/MarkupToHtml.ts` renders note content in safe mode by surrounding it with <pre> and </pre> without escaping any interior HTML tags. Thus an attacker can create a note that closes the opening <pre> tag then includes HTML that runs JavaScript. Because the rendered markdown iframe has the same origin as the toplevel document and is not sandboxed any scripts running in the preview iframe can access the top variable and thus access the toplevel NodeJS `require` function. `require` can then be used to import modules like fs or child_process and run arbitrary commands.

CVE-2024-24821,Composer is a dependency Manager for the PHP language. In affected versions several files within the local working directory are included during the invocation of Composer and in the context of the executing user. As such under certain conditions arbitrary code execution may lead to local privilege escalation provide lateral user movement or malicious code execution when Composer is invoked within a directory with tampered files. All Composer CLI commands are affected including composer.phar's self-update. The following scenarios are of high risk: Composer being run with sudo Pipelines which may execute Composer on untrusted projects Shared environments with developers who run Composer individually on the same project. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 2.7.0 and 2.2.23. It is advised that the patched versions are applied at the earliest convenience. Where not possible the following should be addressed: Remove all sudo composer privileges for all users to mitigate root privilege escalation and avoid running Composer within an untrusted directory or if needed verify that the contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php` and `vendor/composer/installed.php` do not include untrusted code.  A reset can also be done on these files by the following:```sh rm vendor/composer/installed.php vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php composer install --no-scripts --no-plugins ```,8.8,CWE-829

CVE-2024-50115,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory  Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM as bits 4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used and thus VMRUN doesn't enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.  In the absolute worst case scenario failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result in an out-of-bounds read e.g. if the target page is at the end of a memslot and the VMM isn't using guard pages.  Per the APM:    The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer   table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary   with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.  And the SDM's much more explicit:    4:0    Ignored  Note KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs it's only the nSVM flow that is broken.,7.1,CWE-125
