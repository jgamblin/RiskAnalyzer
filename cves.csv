CVE-2025-53018,Lychee is a free open-source photo-management tool. Prior to version 6.6.13 a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint. This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application’s backend to make HTTP requests to any URL they choose. Consequently internal network resources—such as localhost services or cloud-provider metadata endpoints—become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation nor are there any allow-list timeout or size restrictions. Because of this attackers can point the application at internal targets. Using this flaw an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.,3.0,CWE-918

CVE-2022-39273,FlyteAdmin is the control plane for the data processing platform Flyte. Users who enable the default Flyte’s authorization server without changing the default clientid hashes will be exposed to the public internet. In an effort to make enabling authentication easier for Flyte administrators the default configuration for Flyte Admin allows access for Flyte Propeller even after turning on authentication via a hardcoded hashed password. This password is also set on the default Flyte Propeller configmap in the various Flyte Helm charts. Users who enable auth but do not override this setting in Flyte Admin’s configuration may unbeknownst to them be allowing public traffic in by way of this default password with attackers effectively impersonating propeller. This only applies to users who have not specified the ExternalAuthorizationServer setting. Usage of an external auth server automatically turns off this default configuration and are not susceptible to this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.44. Users should manually set the staticClients in the selfAuthServer section of their configuration if they intend to rely on Admin’s internal auth server. Again users who use an external auth server are automatically protected from this vulnerability.,4.8,CWE-798
CVE-2022-40655,This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NIKON NIS-Elements Viewer 1.2100.1483.0.

CVE-2024-56326,Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5 An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.,7.8,CWE-693

CVE-2023-35318,Remote Procedure Call Runtime Denial of Service Vulnerability,6.5,CWE-125
CVE-2024-36971,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race  __dst_negative_advice() does not enforce proper RCU rules when sk->dst_cache must be cleared leading to possible UAF.  RCU rules are that we must first clear sk->sk_dst_cache then call dst_release(old_dst).  Note that sk_dst_reset(sk) is implementing this protocol correctly while __dst_negative_advice() uses the wrong order.  Given that ip6_negative_advice() has special logic against RTF_CACHE this means each of the three ->negative_advice() existing methods must perform the sk_dst_reset() themselves.  Note the check against NULL dst is centralized in __dst_negative_advice() there is no need to duplicate it in various callbacks.  Many thanks to Clement Lecigne for tracking this issue.  This old bug became visible after the blamed commit using UDP sockets.,7.8,CWE-416

However if (as shown above) cdns_uart_console_write runs before port->sysrq is set then it will try to take the port lock anyway. This may result in a deadlock.  Fix this by splitting sysrq handling into two parts. We use the prepare helper under the port lock and defer handling until we release the lock.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-43662,ShokoServer is a media server which specializes in organizing anime. In affected versions the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint is accessible without authentication and is supposed to return default server images.

CVE-2025-2338,A vulnerability which was classified as critical was found in tbeu matio 1.5.28. Affected is the function strdup_vprintf of the file src/io.c. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.,6.3,CWE-119
CVE-2022-1332,One of the API in Mattermost version 6.4.1 and earlier fails to properly protect the permissions which allows the authenticated members with restricted custom admin role to bypass the restrictions and view the server logs and server config.json file contents.,4.3,CWE-200
CVE-2025-45346,SQL Injection vulnerability in Bacula-web before v.9.7.1 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTTP GET request.,8.1,CWE-89
CVE-2023-49909,A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the web interface Radio Scheduling functionality of Tp-Link AC1350 Wireless MU-MIMO Gigabit Access Point (EAP225 V3) v5.1.0 Build 20220926. A specially crafted series of HTTP requests can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability refers specifically to the overflow that occurs via the `action` parameter at offset `0x0045ab38` of the `httpd_portal` binary shipped with v5.1.0 Build 20220926 of the EAP225.,7.2,CWE-121
CVE-2025-48935,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 2.2.0 and prior to versions 2.2.5 it is possible to bypass Deno's permission read/write db permission check by using `ATTACH DATABASE` statement. Version 2.2.5 contains a patch for the issue.,9.1,CWE-863
CVE-2025-54886,skops is a Python library which helps users share and ship their scikit-learn based models. In versions 0.12.0 and below the Card.get_model does not contain any logic to prevent arbitrary code execution. The Card.get_model function supports both joblib and skops for model loading. When loading .skops models it uses skops' secure loading with trusted type validation raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However when non-.zip file formats are provided the function silently falls back to joblib without warning. Unlike skops joblib allows arbitrary code execution during loading bypassing security measures and potentially enabling malicious code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.0.,8.4,CWE-502
CVE-2023-32490, Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.2x -9.5x contains an improper privilege management vulnerability. A high privilege local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to system takeover.   ,6.7,CWE-269
CVE-2024-11851,The NitroPack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary transient update due to a missing capability check on the nitropack_rml_notification function in all versions up to and including 1.17.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber access or higher to update arbitrary transients. Note that these transients can only be updated to integers and not arbitrary values.,4.3,CWE-862
CVE-2022-24101,Acrobat Reader DC versions 20.001.20085 (and earlier) 20.005.3031x (and earlier) and 17.012.30205 (and earlier) are affected by a use-after-free vulnerability that could lead to disclosure of sensitive memory. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass mitigations such as ASLR. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.,3.3,CWE-416
CVE-2022-20371,In dm_bow_dtr and related functions of dm-bow.c there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-195565510References: Upstream kernel,6.4,CWE-667
