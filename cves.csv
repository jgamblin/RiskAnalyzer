CVE-2024-50156,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()  If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then `block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function _does_ have code to try to handle it with:    if (*reg)     dump_addr = *reg;  ...but since dump_addr is initialized to NULL the above is actually a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.  Make the function print Registers not stored when it sees a NULL to solve this. Since we're touching the code fix msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

CVE-2024-42484,ESP-NOW Component provides a connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol. An Out-of-Bound (OOB) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW group type message because there is no check for the addrs_num field of the group type message. This can result in memory corruption related attacks. Normally there are two fields in the group information that need to be checked i.e. the addrs_num field and the addrs_list fileld. Since we only checked the addrs_list field an attacker can send a group type message with an invalid addrs_num field which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer thus causing a memory corruption issue that goes beyond the payload length.,6.5,CWE-125

CVE-2024-46683,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fence  The fence lock is part of the queue therefore in the current design anything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to prevent the queue from being freed.  However currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the queue ref but if something is waiting on the fence the waiter is kicked to wake up at some later point where upon waking up it first grabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have already dropped the queue ref then the lock might already be freed as part of the queue leading to uaf.  To prevent this move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't run into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level lock or only release the queue in the fence release callback however that might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.

CVE-2024-40945,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu: Return right value in iommu_sva_bind_device()  iommu_sva_bind_device() should return either a sva bond handle or an ERR_PTR value in error cases. Existing drivers (idxd and uacce) only check the return value with IS_ERR(). This could potentially lead to a kernel NULL pointer dereference issue if the function returns NULL instead of an error pointer.

CVE-2021-47619,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: Fix queues reservation for XDP  When XDP was configured on a system with large number of CPUs and X722 NIC there was a call trace with NULL pointer dereference.  i40e 0000:87:00.0: failed to get tracking for 256 queues for VSI 0 err -12 i40e 0000:87:00.0: setup of MAIN VSI failed  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference address: 0000000000000000 RIP: 0010:i40e_xdp+0xea/0x1b0 [i40e] Call Trace: ? i40e_reconfig_rss_queues+0x130/0x130 [i40e] dev_xdp_install+0x61/0xe0 dev_xdp_attach+0x18a/0x4c0 dev_change_xdp_fd+0x1e6/0x220 do_setlink+0x616/0x1030 ? ahci_port_stop+0x80/0x80 ? ata_qc_issue+0x107/0x1e0 ? lock_timer_base+0x61/0x80 ? __mod_timer+0x202/0x380 rtnl_setlink+0xe5/0x170 ? bpf_lsm_binder_transaction+0x10/0x10 ? security_capable+0x36/0x50 rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x121/0x350 ? rtnl_calcit.isra.0+0x100/0x100 netlink_rcv_skb+0x50/0xf0 netlink_unicast+0x1d3/0x2a0 netlink_sendmsg+0x22a/0x440 sock_sendmsg+0x5e/0x60 __sys_sendto+0xf0/0x160 ? __sys_getsockname+0x7e/0xc0 ? _copy_from_user+0x3c/0x80 ? __sys_setsockopt+0xc8/0x1a0 __x64_sys_sendto+0x20/0x30 do_syscall_64+0x33/0x40 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae RIP: 0033:0x7f83fa7a39e0  This was caused by PF queue pile fragmentation due to flow director VSI queue being placed right after main VSI. Because of this main VSI was not able to resize its queue allocation for XDP resulting in no queues allocated for main VSI when XDP was turned on.  Fix this by always allocating last queue in PF queue pile for a flow director VSI.,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2024-20313,A vulnerability in the OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of OSPF updates that are processed by a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPF update to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload resulting in a DoS condition.,7.4,CWE-120
CVE-2024-7818,The Misiek Photo Album WordPress plugin through 1.4.3 does not have CSRF check in some places and is missing sanitisation as well as escaping which could allow attackers to make logged in admin add Stored XSS payloads via a CSRF attack.,6.1,CWE-79
CVE-2022-42885,A use of uninitialized pointer vulnerability exists in the GRO format res functionality of Open Babel 3.1.1 and master commit 530dbfa3. A specially crafted malformed file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.,9.8,CWE-824
CVE-2024-9938,The Bounce Handler MailPoet 3 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'page' parameter in all versions up to and including 1.3.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.,6.1,CWE-79
CVE-2022-3801,A vulnerability which was classified as critical was found in IBAX go-ibax. This affects an unknown part of the file /api/v2/open/rowsInfo.
