CVE-2025-55039,This issue affects Apache Spark versions before  3.4.4 3.5.2 and 4.0.0.    Apache Spark versions before 4.0.0 3.5.2 and 3.4.4 use an insecure default network encryption cipher for RPC communication between nodes.  When spark.network.crypto.enabled is set to true (it is set to false by default) but spark.network.crypto.cipher is not explicitly configured Spark defaults to AES in CTR mode (AES/CTR/NoPadding) which provides encryption without authentication.  This vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to modify encrypted RPC traffic undetected by flipping bits in ciphertext potentially compromising heartbeat messages or application data and affecting the integrity of Spark workflows.   To mitigate this issue users should either configure spark.network.crypto.cipher to AES/GCM/NoPadding to enable authenticated encryption or  enable SSL encryption by setting spark.ssl.enabled to true which provides stronger transport security.,6.5,CWE-326

CVE-2025-8452,By using the uscan protocol provided by the eSCL specification an attacker can discover the serial number of multi-function printers that implement the Brother-provided firmware.

CVE-2023-20243,A vulnerability in the RADIUS message processing feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing RADIUS packets.    This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS accounting requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to a network access device (NAD) that uses Cisco ISE for authentication authorization and accounting (AAA). This would eventually result in the NAD sending a RADIUS accounting request packet to Cisco ISE. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RADIUS accounting request packet to Cisco ISE directly if the RADIUS shared secret is known. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the RADIUS process to unexpectedly restart resulting in authentication or authorization timeouts and denying legitimate users access to the network or service. Clients already authenticated to the network would not be affected.    Note: To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) may be required. For more information see the Details [#details] section of this advisory.,8.6,CWE-399

Starting with the 8.1 branch and prior to versions 8.5.16 9.2.10 and 9.3.4 Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because SVG files weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance.

CVE-2024-58099,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame  Andrew and Nikolay reported connectivity issues with Cilium's service load-balancing in case of vmxnet3.  If a BPF program for native XDP adds an encapsulation header such as IPIP and transmits the packet out the same interface then in case of vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped on the path.  vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp() through vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect DMA address:    page = virt_to_page(xdpf->data);   tbi->dma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +                   VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM;   dma_sync_single_for_device(&adapter->pdev->dev                              tbi->dma_addr buf_size                              DMA_TO_DEVICE);  The above assumes a fixed offset (VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM) but the XDP BPF program could have moved xdp->data. While the passed buf_size is correct (xdpf->len) the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which can be calculated as xdpf->data - (void *)xdpf that is xdp->data - xdp->data_hard_start.,5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2022-24755,Bareos is open source software for backup archiving and recovery of data for operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM authentication it will skip authorization checks completely. Expired accounts and accounts with expired passwords can still login. This problem will affect users that have PAM enabled. Currently there is no authorization (e.g. check for expired or disabled accounts) but only plain authentication (i.e. check if username and password match). Bareos Director versions 21.1.0 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 implement the authorization check that was previously missing. The only workaround is to make sure that authentication fails if the user is not authorized.,8.1,CWE-863

CVE-2023-29453,Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used since ES6 for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex and themselves can do string interpolation the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. var a = {{.}}) since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix Template. Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1 with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.,9.8,CWE-94
