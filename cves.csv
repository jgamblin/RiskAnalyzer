CVE-2024-47083,Power Platform Terraform Provider allows managing environments and other resources within Power Platform. Versions prior to 3.0.0 have an issue in the Power Platform Terraform Provider where sensitive information specifically the `client_secret` used in the service principal authentication may be exposed in logs. This exposure occurs due to an error in the logging code that causes the `client_secret` to not be properly masked when logs are persisted or viewed. Users should upgrade to version 3.0.0 to receive a patched version of the provider that removes all logging of sensitive content. Users who have used this provider with the affected versions should take the following additional steps to mitigate the risk: Immediately rotate the `client_secret` for any service principal that has been configured using this Terraform provider. This will invalidate any potentially exposed secrets. Those who have set the `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variable or configured Terraform to persist logs to a file or an external system consider disabling this until they have updated to a fixed version of the provider. Those who have existing logs that may contain the `client_secret` should remove or sanitize these logs to prevent unauthorized access. This includes logs on disk in monitoring systems or in logging services.,7.5,CWE-117

CVE-2023-41335,Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. When users update their passwords the new credentials may be briefly held in the server database. While this doesn't grant the server any added capabilities—it already learns the users' passwords as part of the authentication process—it does disrupt the expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a result these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups for a longer duration. These temporarily stored passwords are automatically erased after a 48-hour window. This issue has been addressed in version 1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,3.7,CWE-312

CVE-2024-49997,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet: lantiq_etop: fix memory disclosure  When applying padding the buffer is not zeroed which results in memory disclosure. The mentioned data is observed on the wire. This patch uses skb_put_padto() to pad Ethernet frames properly. The mentioned function zeroes the expanded buffer.  In case the packet cannot be padded it is silently dropped. Statistics are also not incremented. This driver does not support statistics in the old 32-bit format or the new 64-bit format. These will be added in the future. In its current form the patch should be easily backported to stable versions.  Ethernet MACs on Amazon-SE and Danube cannot do padding of the packets in hardware so software padding must be applied.,7.5,CWE-212

CVE-2023-52456,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock  When using the serial port as RS485 port the tx statemachine is used to control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the TTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during userland application crash) imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission to be retriggered by the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx statemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in deadlock now and the TX_EN remains low making the interface useless.  imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure the state machine handling is reached and is properly set to WAIT_AFTER_SEND.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2021-47542,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: qlogic: qlcnic: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in qlcnic_83xx_add_rings()  In qlcnic_83xx_add_rings() the indirect function of ahw->hw_ops->alloc_mbx_args will be called to allocate memory for cmd.req.arg and there is a dereference of it in qlcnic_83xx_add_rings() which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of the indirect function like qlcnic_83xx_alloc_mbx_args().  Fix this bug by adding a check of alloc_mbx_args() this patch imitates the logic of mbx_cmd()'s failure handling.  This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations (e.g. checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or the callers so they constitute bugs.  Note that as a bug found by static analysis it can be a false positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed the bug.  Builds with CONFIG_QLCNIC=m show no new warnings and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.,5.5,CWE-476
