CVE-2024-41084,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/region: Avoid null pointer dereference in region lookup  cxl_dpa_to_region() looks up a region based on a memdev and DPA. It wrongly assumes an endpoint found mapping the DPA is also of a fully assembled region. When not true it leads to a null pointer dereference looking up the region name.  This appears during testing of region lookup after a failure to assemble a BIOS defined region or if the lookup raced with the assembly of the BIOS defined region.  Failure to clean up BIOS defined regions that fail assembly is an issue in itself and a fix to that problem will alleviate some of the impact. It will not alleviate the race condition so let's harden this path.  The behavior change is that the kernel oops due to a null pointer dereference is replaced with a dev_dbg() message noting that an endpoint was mapped.  Additional comments are added so that future users of this function can more clearly understand what it provides.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-0851,There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.,5.5,CWE-200

CVE-2022-24801,Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0rc1 the Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server located in the `twisted.web.http` module parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230. This non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling. Users who may be affected use Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy and also pass requests through a different HTTP server and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client is not affected. The HTTP 2.0 server uses a different parser so it is not affected. The issue has been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1. Two workarounds are available: Ensure any vulnerabilities in upstream proxies have been addressed such as by upgrading them; or filter malformed requests by other means such as configuration of an upstream proxy.,8.1,CWE-444

If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input and renders these in pages that other users see as well an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2024-46851,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn10_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()  dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe context passed to dcn10_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.  If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which calls dcn10_set_drr() at some point) we can end up using already nulled function callback fields of struct stream_resource.  The logic in dcn10_set_drr() already tries to avoid this by checking tg against NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and before the next access then we get a race.  Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable and then use this variable for all the operations. This should work as long as nobody frees the resource pool where the timing generators live.

CVE-2021-47008,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating  Access to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the GHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCB might not be mapped.  The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered. However if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold then the GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT) which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.  The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about any errors. While it is likely that the GHCB will be mapped in this situation add a safe guard in this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-23576,Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateOutputSize` is vulnerable to an integer overflow if an attacker can create an operation which would involve tensors with large enough number of elements. We can have a large enough number of dimensions in `output_shape.dim()` or just a small number of dimensions being large enough to cause an overflow in the multiplication. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1 TensorFlow 2.6.3 and TensorFlow 2.5.3 as these are also affected and still in supported range.,6.5,CWE-190
CVE-2023-35946,Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency cache it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates Gradle can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside the dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle process has write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will refuse to cache dependencies that have path traversal elements in their dependency coordinates. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2 `dependency verification` will make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit.,6.9,CWE-22

CVE-2023-33187,Highlight is an open source full-stack monitoring platform. Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type=text` via a javascript Show Password button.

CVE-2023-46733,Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 5.4.21 and 6.2.7 and prior to versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8 `SessionStrategyListener` does not migrate the session after every successful login. It does so only in case the logged in user changes by means of checking the user identifier. In some use cases the user identifier doesn't change between the verification phase and the successful login while the token itself changes from one type (partially-authenticated) to another (fully-authenticated). When this happens the session id should be regenerated to prevent possible session fixations which is not the case at the moment. As of versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8 Symfony now checks the type of the token in addition to the user identifier before deciding whether the session id should be regenerated.,6.5,CWE-384
