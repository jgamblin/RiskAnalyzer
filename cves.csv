CVE-2024-26995,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: tcpm: Correct the PDO counting in pd_set  Off-by-one errors happen because nr_snk_pdo and nr_src_pdo are incorrectly added one. The index of the loop is equal to the number of PDOs to be updated when leaving the loop and it doesn't need to be added one.  When doing the power negotiation TCPM relies on the nr_snk_pdo as the size of the local sink PDO array to match the Source capabilities of the partner port. If the off-by-one overflow occurs a wrong RDO might be sent and unexpected power transfer might happen such as over voltage or over current (than expected).  nr_src_pdo is used to set the Rp level when the port is in Source role. It is also the array size of the local Source capabilities when filling up the buffer which will be sent as the Source PDOs (such as in Power Negotiation). If the off-by-one overflow occurs a wrong Rp level might be set and wrong Source PDOs will be sent to the partner port. This could potentially cause over current or port resets.,7.8,CWE-193

CVE-2022-41952,Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will attempt to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting connection time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server (for instance Icecast). This can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is for example posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not supported and always fails 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0 to fully resolve the issue. As a workaround turn off URL preview functionality by setting `url_preview_enabled: false` in the Synapse configuration file.,6.5,CWE-400

CVE-2023-41045,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Graylog makes use of only one single source port for DNS queries. Graylog binds a single socket for outgoing DNS queries and while that socket is bound to a random port number it is never changed again. This goes against recommended practice since 2008 when Dan Kaminsky discovered how easy is to carry out DNS cache poisoning attacks. In order to prevent cache poisoning with spoofed DNS responses it is necessary to maximise the uncertainty in the choice of a source port for a DNS query. Although unlikely in many setups an external attacker could inject forged DNS responses into a Graylog's lookup table cache. In order to prevent this it is at least recommendable to distribute the DNS queries through a pool of distinct sockets each of them with a random source port and renew them periodically. This issue has been addressed in versions 5.0.9 and 5.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,3.7,CWE-345

CVE-2024-4536,In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2 in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) an attacker might obtain OAuth2 client secrets from the vault.  In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2 we have identified a security vulnerability in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) regarding the OAuth2-protected data sink feature. When using a custom OAuth2-protected data sink the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically the consumer-provided clientSecretKey which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault is resolved in the context of the provider's vault not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl also consumer-controlled as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.  This feature is now disabled entirely because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.  ,6.8,CWE-201

The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.,6.3,CWE-74
CVE-2024-48984,An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. When parsing hci reports the hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of a list of reports by reading a byte from an input stream. It then fetches the length of the first report uses it to calculate the beginning of the second report etc. In doing this it tracks the largest report so it can later allocate a buffer that fits every individual report (but only one at a time). It does not however validate that these addresses are all contained within the buffer passed to hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport. It is then possible though unlikely that the buffer designated to hold the reports is allocated in such a way that one of these out-of-bounds length fields is contained within the new buffer. When the (n-1)th report is copied it overwrites the length field of the nth report. This now corrupted length field is then used for a memcpy into the new buffer which may lead to a buffer overflow.,9.8,CWE-120
CVE-2024-31670,rizin before v0.6.3 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via create_cache_bins read_cache_accel and rz_dyldcache_new_buf functions in librz/bin/format/mach0/dyldcache.c.,6.3,CWE-120

CVE-2025-21857,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: cls_api: fix error handling causing NULL dereference  tcf_exts_miss_cookie_base_alloc() calls xa_alloc_cyclic() which can return 1 if the allocation succeeded after wrapping. This was treated as an error with value 1 returned to caller tcf_exts_init_ex() which sets exts->actions to NULL and returns 1 to caller fl_change().  fl_change() treats err == 1 as success calling tcf_exts_validate_ex() which calls tcf_action_init() with exts->actions as argument where it is dereferenced.  Example trace:  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference address: 0000000000000000 CPU: 114 PID: 16151 Comm: handler114 Kdump: loaded Not tainted 5.14.0-503.16.1.el9_5.x86_64 #1 RIP: 0010:tcf_action_init+0x1f8/0x2c0 Call Trace:  tcf_action_init+0x1f8/0x2c0  tcf_exts_validate_ex+0x175/0x190  fl_change+0x537/0x1120 [cls_flower],5.5,CWE-476
