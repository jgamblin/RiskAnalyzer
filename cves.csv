CVE-2025-52573,iOS Simulator MCP Server (ios-simulator-mcp) is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with iOS simulators. Versions prior to 1.3.3 are written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation. The MCP Server exposes the tool `ui_tap` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input. LLM exposed user input for `duration` `udid` and `x` and `y` args can be replaced with shell meta-characters like `;` or `&&` or others to change the behavior from running the expected command `idb` to another command. When LLMs are tricked through prompt injection (and other techniques and attack vectors) to call the tool with input that uses special shell characters such as `; rm -rf /tmp;#` and other payload variations the full command-line text will be interepted by the shell and result in other commands except of `ps` executing on the host running the MCP Server.

CVE-2024-57876,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/dp_mst: Fix resetting msg rx state after topology removal  If the MST topology is removed during the reception of an MST down reply or MST up request sideband message the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::up_req_recv/down_rep_recv states could be reset from one thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false) racing with the reading/parsing of the message from another thread via drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() or drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(). The race is possible since the reader/parser doesn't hold any lock while accessing the reception state. This in turn can lead to a memory corruption in the reader/parser as described by commit bd2fccac61b4 (drm/dp_mst: Fix MST sideband message body length check).  Fix the above by resetting the message reception state if needed before reading/parsing a message. Another solution would be to hold the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::lock for the whole duration of the message reception/parsing in drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() and drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req() however this would require a bigger change. Since the fix is also needed for stable opting for the simpler solution in this patch.,7.0,CWE-362

CVE-2025-24376,kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register Kubewarden admission policies. By design AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup can evaluate only namespaced resources. The resources to be evaluated are determined by the rules provided by the user when defining the policy. There might be Kubernetes namespaced resources that should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies because of their sensitive nature. For example PolicyReport are namespaced resources that contain the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace. An attacker can use either an AdmissionPolicy or an AdmissionPolicyGroup to prevent the creation and update of PolicyReport objects to hide non-compliant resources. Moreover the same attacker might use a mutating AdmissionPolicy to alter the contents of the PolicyReport created inside of the namespace. Starting from the 1.21.0 release the validation rules applied to AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup have been tightened to prevent them from validating sensitive types of namespaced resources.,6.5,CWE-155

CVE-2024-20266,A vulnerability in the DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) server feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a crash of the dhcpd process resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.    This vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4 messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the dhcpd process. While the dhcpd process is restarting which may take approximately two minutes DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on the affected device. This could temporarily prevent network access to clients that join the network during that time period and rely on the DHCPv4 server of the affected device.    Notes:       Only the dhcpd process crashes and eventually restarts automatically. The router does not reload.  This vulnerability only applies to DHCPv4. DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) is not affected.,5.3,CWE-476

CVE-2024-26630,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk  In cachestat we access the folio from the page cache's xarray to compute its page offset and check for its dirty and writeback flags.  However we do not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions which means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as another folio/page/slab.  Get around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery for the folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states.  This changes behavior for tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their dirty and writeback counters.  This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow conventional writeback cache behavior: its pages get cleaned during swapout after which they're no longer resident etc.,7.1,CWE-416
