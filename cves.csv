CVE-2025-52572,Hikka a Telegram userbot has vulnerability affects all users on all versions of Hikka. Two scenarios are possible. 1. Web interface does not have an authenticated session: attacker can use his own Telegram account to gain RCE to the server by authorizing in the dangling web interface. 2. Web interface does have an authenticated session: due to insufficient warning in the authentication message users were tempted to click Allow in the Allow web application ops menu. This gave an attacker access not only to remote code execution but also to Telegram accounts of owners. Scenario number 2 is known to have been exploited in the wild. No known patches are available but some workarounds are available. Use `--no-web` flag and do not start userbot without it; after authorizing in the web interface close the port on the server and/or start the userbot with `--no-web` flag; and do not click Allow in your helper bot unless it is your explicit action that needs to be allowed.,10.0,CWE-287

CVE-2024-42082,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xdp: Remove WARN() from __xdp_reg_mem_model()  syzkaller reports a warning in __xdp_reg_mem_model().  The warning occurs only if __mem_id_init_hash_table() returns an error. It returns the error in two cases:    1. memory allocation fails;   2. rhashtable_init() fails when some fields of rhashtable_params      struct are not initialized properly.  The second case cannot happen since there is a static const rhashtable_params struct with valid fields. So warning is only triggered when there is a problem with memory allocation.  Thus there is no sense in using WARN() to handle this error and it can be safely removed.

CVE-2025-54469,A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector where the enforcer used environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen without first sanitising their values.   The entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor  process. When the enforcer container stops the monitor process checks  whether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check the  monitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.   The values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT  are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without  validation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user  to inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer  container.,9.9,CWE-78

CVE-2024-24823,Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id even if for different user credentials. In this case the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an attack is high because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 and any versions of the 6.0 development branch contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists but is relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions` endpoint as that is the only one vulnerable.,5.7,CWE-384

Example A:    CPU0                               CPU1   ----                               ----   icc_set_bw(path_a)     mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);                                      icc_put(path_b)                                        mutex_lock(&icc_lock);     aggregate_requests()       hlist_for_each_entry(r ...                                        hlist_del(...         <r = invalid pointer>  Example B:    CPU0                               CPU1   ----                               ----   icc_set_bw(path_a)     mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);                                      path_b = of_icc_get()                                        of_icc_get_by_index()                                          mutex_lock(&icc_lock);                                          path_find()                                            path_init()     aggregate_requests()       hlist_for_each_entry(r ...                                              hlist_add_head(...         <r = invalid pointer>  Fix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held before manipulating icc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is held don't perform any memory allocations so we should still be safe from the original lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.

CVE-2023-22475,Canarytokens is an open source tool which helps track activity and actions on your network. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens prior to sha-fb61290. An attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) can use this to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's trigger history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the Canarytoken's creator.  This vulnerability could be used to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken or view its activation history. It might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing more information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For example an attacker could recover the email address tied to the Canarytoken or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the creator's network location.  This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-31113 but affected parameters reported differently from the Canarytoken trigger request. An attacker could only act on the discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens or other Canarytoken creators. Canarytokens Docker images sha-fb61290 and later contain a patch for this issue.,6.3,CWE-79

CVE-2024-30252,Livemarks is a browser extension that provides RSS feed bookmark folders. Versions of Livemarks prior to 3.7 are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request. The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML. `subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html` an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`. This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker this integrity is broken. Version 3.7 fixes this issue by removing subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources`. ,2.6,CWE-352
