CVE-2024-27308,Mio is a Metal I/O library for Rust. When using named pipes on Windows mio will under some circumstances return invalid tokens that correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered from the mio registry. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how mio is used. For some applications invalid tokens may be ignored or cause a warning or a crash. On the other hand for applications that store pointers in the tokens this vulnerability may result in a use-after-free. For users of Tokio this vulnerability is serious and can result in a use-after-free in Tokio. The vulnerability is Windows-specific and can only happen if you are using named pipes. Other IO resources are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in mio v0.8.11. All versions of mio between v0.7.2 and v0.8.10 are vulnerable. Tokio is vulnerable when you are using a vulnerable version of mio AND you are using at least Tokio v1.30.0. Versions of Tokio prior to v1.30.0 will ignore invalid tokens so they are not vulnerable. Vulnerable libraries that use mio can work around this issue by detecting and ignoring invalid tokens.,7.5,CWE-416

CVE-2024-56740,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs/localio: must clear res.replen in nfs_local_read_done  Otherwise memory corruption can occur due to NFSv3 LOCALIO reads leaving garbage in res.replen: - nfs3_read_done() copies that into server->read_hdrsize; from there   nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests. - nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()   which includes it in hdrsize for xdr_init_pages so that rq_rcv_buf   contains a ridiculous len. - This is copied to rq_private_buf and xs_read_stream_request()   eventually passes the kvec to sock_recvmsg() which receives incoming   data into entirely the wrong place.  This is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads when it is made to pivot back to using normal RPC.  This switch back to using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this issue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3 server while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2024-46851,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn10_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()  dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe context passed to dcn10_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.  If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which calls dcn10_set_drr() at some point) we can end up using already nulled function callback fields of struct stream_resource.  The logic in dcn10_set_drr() already tries to avoid this by checking tg against NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and before the next access then we get a race.  Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable and then use this variable for all the operations. This should work as long as nobody frees the resource pool where the timing generators live.

CVE-2022-31108,Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to load a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions such as clicking on a link etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is adequately escaped before embedding it in CSS blocks.,4.1,CWE-74

Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.6 CUPS logs data of free memory to the logging service AFTER the connection has been closed when it should have logged the data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.  The exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con->http)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always provided its argument is not null frees the pointer at the end of the call only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.

CVE-2023-34231,gosnowflake is th Snowflake Golang driver. Prior to version 1.6.19 a command injection vulnerability exists in the Snowflake Golang driver via single sign-on (SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. A patch is available in version 1.6.19.,8.8,CWE-77

CVE-2024-39506,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  liquidio: Adjust a NULL pointer handling path in lio_vf_rep_copy_packet  In lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() pg_info->page is compared to a NULL value but then it is unconditionally passed to skb_add_rx_frag() which looks strange and could lead to null pointer dereference.  lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() call trace looks like: 	octeon_droq_process_packets 	 octeon_droq_fast_process_packets 	  octeon_droq_dispatch_pkt 	   octeon_create_recv_info 	    ...search in the dispatch_list... 	     ->disp_fn(rdisp->rinfo ...) 	      lio_vf_rep_pkt_recv(struct octeon_recv_info *recv_info ...) In this path there is no code which sets pg_info->page to NULL. So this check looks unneeded and doesn't solve potential problem. But I guess the author had reason to add a check and I have no such card and can't do real test. In addition the code in the function liquidio_push_packet() in liquidio/lio_core.c does exactly the same.  Based on this I consider the most acceptable compromise solution to adjust this issue by moving skb_add_rx_frag() into conditional scope.
