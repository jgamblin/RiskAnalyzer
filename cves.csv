CVE-2022-37866,When Apache Ivy downloads artifacts from a repository it stores them in the local file system based on a user-supplied pattern that may include placeholders for artifacts coordinates like the organisation module or version. If said coordinates contain ../ sequences - which are valid characters for Ivy coordinates in general - it is possible the artifacts are stored outside of Ivy's local cache or repository or can overwrite different artifacts inside of the local cache. In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs collaboration by the remote repository as Ivy will issue http requests containing .. sequences and a normal repository will not interpret them as part of the artifact coordinates. Users of Apache Ivy 2.0.0 to 2.5.1 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.,7.5,CWE-22

CVE-2023-46129,NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology built for the cloud on-premise IoT and edge computing. The cryptographic key handling library nkeys recently gained support for encryption not just for signing/authentication. This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys versions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5 corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3 the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handling logic mistakenly passed an array by value into an internal function where the function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. As a result all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects encryption only not signing.   FIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTH CALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys Go library 0.4.6 corresponding with NATS Server 2.10.4 has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.

CVE-2024-35895,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem  syzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes elements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be invoked from any interrupt context locks taken during a map_delete_elem operation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion is possible as reported by lockdep:         CPU0                    CPU1        ----                    ----   lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);                                local_irq_disable();                                lock(&host->lock);                                lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);   <Interrupt>     lock(&host->lock);  Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be deleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts enabled or in softirq context.  Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is _not_ hardirq-unsafe that is interrupts are disabled and bail out with an error.  Note that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does not allow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-45822,Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding installing and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects. During a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base a security researcher identified a bug in which a default unsafe rego built-in was allowed to be used when defining authorization policies. Artifact Hub includes a fine-grained authorization mechanism that allows organizations to define what actions can be performed by their members. It is based on customizable authorization policies that are enforced by the `Open Policy Agent`. Policies are written using `rego` and their data files are expected to be json documents. By default `rego` allows policies to make HTTP requests which can be abused to send requests to internal resources and forward the responses to an external entity. In the context of Artifact Hub this capability should have been disabled. This issue has been resolved in version `1.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,3.7,CWE-918

We must call ->destroy function of the object.  nft_obj_destroy does this but it also decrements the module refcount but the update path doesn't increment it.  To avoid special-casing the update object release do module_get for the update case too and release it via nft_obj_destroy().,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-12797,Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated because handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode is set.  Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not detected by clients.  RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server and the server likewise enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.  Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result() and those that do and take appropriate action are not affected.  This issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.  The FIPS modules in 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.,6.3,CWE-392
