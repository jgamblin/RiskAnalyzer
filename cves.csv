CVE-2023-51442,Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. A security vulnerability has been identified in navidrome's subsonic endpoint allowing for authentication bypass. This exploit enables unauthorized access to any known account by utilizing a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with the key not so secret. The vulnerability can only be exploited on instances that have never been restarted. Navidrome supports an extension to the subsonic authentication scheme where a JWT can be provided using a `jwt` query parameter instead of the traditional password or token and salt (corresponding to resp. the `p` or `t` and `s` query parameters). This authentication bypass vulnerability potentially affects all instances that don't protect the subsonic endpoint `/rest/` which is expected to be most instances in a standard deployment and most instances in the reverse proxy setup too (as the documentation mentions to leave that endpoint unprotected). This issue has been patched in version 0.50.2. ,8.6,CWE-287

CVE-2024-55603,Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`) to store the session data in a database. Therefore when a `session_id` is given kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point it does not correctly verify if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus a session which's lifetime is already `> time()` is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function that does remove invalid sessions is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()` based on `session.gc_divisor` `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1 session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-613

CVE-2022-39242,Frontier is an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate. Prior to commit d3beddc6911a559a3ecc9b3f08e153dbe37a8658 the worst case weight was always accounted as the block weight for all cases.

CVE-2022-4814,Improper Access Control in GitHub repository usememos/memos prior to 0.9.1.,4.3,CWE-284
CVE-2023-0286,There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.  When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag) this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point which is uncommon. As such this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.,7.4,CWE-843

CVE-2024-47739,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  padata: use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow  When submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial the current sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects with overflowed seq_nr causing them to be placed before existing objects in the reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process as padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr and pd->processed because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected next.  To fix this we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort padata objects in scenarios with integer overflow.,5.5,CWE-190

CVE-2024-22410,Creditcoin is a network that enables cross-blockchain credit transactions. The Windows binary of the Creditcoin node loads a suite of DLLs provided by Microsoft at startup. If a malicious user has access to overwrite the program files directory it is possible to replace these DLLs and execute arbitrary code. It is the view of the blockchain development team that the threat posed by a hypothetical binary planting attack is minimal and represents a low-security risk. The vulnerable DLL files are from the Windows networking subsystem the Visual C++ runtime and low-level cryptographic primitives. Collectively these dependencies are required for a large ecosystem of applications ranging from enterprise-level security applications to game engines and don’t represent a fundamental lack of security or oversight in the design and implementation of Creditcoin. The blockchain team takes the stance that running Creditcoin on Windows is officially unsupported and at best should be thought of as experimental.,3.3,CWE-426

CVE-2023-47641,aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Affected versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability regarding the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a persistent protocol if both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE) header values are present it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation. A possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked we can pass a chunked123 as TE the frontend entity will ignore this header and will parse Content-Length. The impact of this vulnerability is that it is possible to bypass any proxy rule poisoning sockets to other users like passing Authentication Headers also if it is present an Open Redirect an attacker could combine it to redirect random users to another website and log the request. This vulnerability has been addressed in release 3.8.0 of aiohttp. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,3.4,CWE-444

CVE-2024-56326,Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5 An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.,7.8,CWE-693
