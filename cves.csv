CVE-2022-48890,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: storvsc: Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VM  storvsc_queuecommand() maps the scatter/gather list using scsi_dma_map() which in a confidential VM allocates swiotlb bounce buffers. If the I/O submission fails in storvsc_do_io() the I/O is typically retried by higher level code but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like cause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer which is not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffer memory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problem can arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter swiotlb=force.  Fix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission error which frees the bounce buffer memory.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2022-36035,Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories) and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux CLI allows users to deploy Flux components into a Kubernetes cluster via command-line. The vulnerability allows other applications to replace the Flux deployment information with arbitrary content which is deployed into the target Kubernetes cluster instead. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of user-supplied input which results in a path traversal that can be controlled by the attacker. Users sharing the same shell between other applications and the Flux CLI commands could be affected by this vulnerability. In some scenarios no errors may be presented which may cause end users not to realize that something is amiss. A safe workaround is to execute Flux CLI in ephemeral and isolated shell environments which can ensure no persistent values exist from previous processes. However upgrading to the latest version of the CLI is still the recommended mitigation strategy.,7.7,CWE-22

CVE-2024-56670,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget: u_serial: Fix the issue that gs_start_io crashed due to accessing null pointer  Considering that in some extreme cases when u_serial driver is accessed by multiple threads Thread A is executing the open operation and calling the gs_open Thread B is executing the disconnect operation and calling the gserial_disconnect functionThe port->port_usb pointer will be set to NULL.

An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-49419,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  video: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup  Commit b3c9a924aab6 (fbdev: vesafb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather than .remove) fixed a use-after-free error due the vesafb driver freeing the fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.  This can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove callback since the former tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.  But that change didn't take into account that another possible scenario is that .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback. For example if no process has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.  If that's the case fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is called making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that to no longer be valid.  To prevent that move the expression containing the info->par to happen before the unregister_framebuffer() function call.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-47776,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read has been discovered in gst_wavparse_cue_chunk within gstwavparse.c. The vulnerability happens due to a discrepancy between the size of the data buffer and the size value provided to the function. This mismatch causes the comparison  if (size < 4 + ncues * 24) to fail in some cases allowing the subsequent loop to access beyond the bounds of the data buffer. The root cause of this discrepancy stems from a miscalculation when clipping the chunk size based on upstream data size. This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.,9.1,CWE-125

CVE-2025-22150,Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client. Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to versions 5.28.5 6.21.1 and 7.2.3 undici uses `Math.random()` to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the output of `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its generated values are known. If there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests to an attacker-controlled website they can use this to leak the necessary values. Therefore an attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are met. This is fixed in versions 5.28.5 6.21.1 and 7.2.3.

CVE-2022-41952,Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will attempt to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting connection time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server (for instance Icecast). This can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is for example posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not supported and always fails 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0 to fully resolve the issue. As a workaround turn off URL preview functionality by setting `url_preview_enabled: false` in the Synapse configuration file.,6.5,CWE-400
