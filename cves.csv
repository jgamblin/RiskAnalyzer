CVE-2024-26799,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: qcom: Fix uninitialized pointer dmactl  In the case where __lpass_get_dmactl_handle is called and the driver id dai_id is invalid the pointer dmactl is not being assigned a value and dmactl contains a garbage value since it has not been initialized and so the null check may not work. Fix this to initialize dmactl to NULL. One could argue that modern compilers will set this to zero but it is useful to keep this initialized as per the same way in functions __lpass_platform_codec_intf_init and lpass_cdc_dma_daiops_hw_params.  Cleans up clang scan build warning: sound/soc/qcom/lpass-cdc-dma.c:275:7: warning: Branch condition evaluates to a garbage value [core.uninitialized.Branch],6.2,CWE-824

CVE-2023-28645,Nextcloud richdocuments is a Nextcloud app integrating the office suit Collabora Online. In affected versions the secure view feature of the rich documents app can be bypassed by using unprotected internal API endpoint of the rich documents app. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Office app (richdocuments) is upgraded to 8.0.0-beta.1 7.0.2 or 6.3.2. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the issue by taking steps to restrict the ability to download documents. This includes ensuring that the `WOPI configuration` is configured to only serve documents between Nextcloud and Collabora. It is highly recommended to define the list of Collabora server IPs as the allow list within the Office admin settings of Nextcloud.,5.7,CWE-284
CVE-2025-62430,ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. ClipBucket v5 through build 5.5.2 #145 allows stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in multiple video and photo metadata fields. For videos the Tags field and the Genre Actors Producer Executive Producer and Director fields in Movieinfos accept user supplied values without adequate sanitization. For photos the Photo Title and Photo Tags fields accept user supplied values without adequate sanitization. A regular user who can edit a video or photo can inject script (for example by supplying a value such as a closing delimiter followed by a script element). The injected script executes when any user including an unauthenticated visitor or an administrator views the affected video or photo page. Although cookies are set with the HttpOnly attribute and cannot be read directly the injected script can issue fetch requests to endpoints such as admin_area pages and exfiltrate their contents or trigger unintended actions. Version 5.5.2 build #146 and later contain a fix. Update to build 5.5.2 #146 or later. No known workarounds exist.,5.4,CWE-79
CVE-2025-9426,A weakness has been identified in itsourcecode Online Tour and Travel Management System 1.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /package.php.

CVE-2021-43106,A Header Injection vulnerability exists in Compass Plus TranzWare Online FIMI Web Interface Tranzware Online (TWO) 5.3.33.3 F38 and FIMI 4.2.19.4 25.The HTTP host header can be manipulated and cause the application to behave in unexpected ways. Any changes made to the header would just cause the request to be sent to a completely different Domain/IP address. This is due to that the server implicitly trusts the Host header and fails to validate or escape it properly. An attacker can use this input to redirect target users to a malicious domain/web page. This would result in expanding the potential to further attacks and malicious actions.,6.1,CWE-116
CVE-2025-6050,Mezzanine CMS in versions prior to 6.1.1 contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the admin interface.

CVE-2023-51568,Kofax Power PDF OXPS File Parsing Use-After-Free Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of OXPS files.

CVE-2023-33528,halo v1.6.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS).,6.1,CWE-79
CVE-2024-50271,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  signal: restore the override_rlimit logic  Prior to commit d64696905554 (Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of ucounts) UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally even if override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.    For example if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV signal sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the signal delivery preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo.  This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and handling the error.  From the user-space perspective applications are unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes as we observed with java applications.  Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively restores the old behavior.,5.5,CWE-770

CVE-2025-24028,Joplin is a free open source note taking and to-do application which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by differences between how Joplin's HTML sanitizer handles comments and how the browser handles comments. This affects both the Rich Text Editor and the Markdown viewer. However unlike the Rich Text Editor the Markdown viewer is `cross-origin isolated` which prevents JavaScript from directly accessing functions/variables in the toplevel Joplin `window`. This issue is not present in Joplin 3.1.24 and may have been introduced in `9b50539`. This is an XSS vulnerability that impacts users that open untrusted notes in the Rich Text Editor. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.2.12 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.8,CWE-79

CVE-2022-0028,A PAN-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware) VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target. To be misused by an external attacker the firewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a source zone that has an external facing interface. This configuration is not typical for URL filtering and if set is likely unintended by the administrator. If exploited this issue would not impact the confidentiality integrity or availability of our products. However the resulting denial-of-service (DoS) attack may help obfuscate the identity of the attacker and implicate the firewall as the source of the attack.

CVE-2024-56619,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()  Syzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the inode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value memory access outside the folio/page range may occur or a use-after-free bug may be detected if KASAN is enabled.  This is because nilfs_last_byte() which is called by nilfs_find_entry() and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a page from i_size and the page index loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit size information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which the i_size value is assigned.  This caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry() resulting in memory access that exceeds the folio/page size.  Fix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit loss from unsigned int to u64.  The return value of nilfs_last_byte() is also of type unsigned int but it is truncated so as not to exceed PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs so no change is required.,7.8,CWE-416
