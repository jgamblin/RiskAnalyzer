CVE-2022-25277,Drupal core sanitizes filenames with dangerous extensions upon upload (reference: SA-CORE-2020-012) and strips leading and trailing dots from filenames to prevent uploading server configuration files (reference: SA-CORE-2019-010). However the protections for these two vulnerabilities previously did not work correctly together. As a result if the site were configured to allow the upload of files with an htaccess extension these files' filenames would not be properly sanitized. This could allow bypassing the protections provided by Drupal core's default .htaccess files and possible remote code execution on Apache web servers. This issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires a field administrator to explicitly configure a file field to allow htaccess as an extension (a restricted permission) or a contributed module or custom code that overrides allowed file uploads.,7.2,CWE-434

CVE-2024-43790,Vim is an open source command line text editor. When performing a search and displaying the search-count message is disabled (:set shm+=S) the search pattern is displayed at the bottom of the screen in a buffer (msgbuf). When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled the search pattern is reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern contains some ASCII NUL characters the buffer allocated will be smaller than the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed buffer the strlen() function is called which only counts until it notices an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is wrong. This causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by the previously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0689.,4.5,CWE-122

CVE-2022-23649,Cosign provides container signing verification and storage in an OCI registry for the sigstore project. Prior to version 1.5.2 Cosign can be manipulated to claim that an entry for a signature exists in the Rekor transparency log even if it doesn't. This requires the attacker to have pull and push permissions for the signature in OCI. This can happen with both standard signing with a keypair and keyless signing with Fulcio. If an attacker has access to the signature in OCI they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor even though it wasn't. The vulnerability has been patched in v1.5.2 of Cosign. The `signature` in the `signedEntryTimestamp` provided by Rekor is now compared to the `signature` that is being verified. If these don't match then an error is returned. If a valid bundle is copied to a different signature verification should fail. Cosign output now only informs the user that certificates were verified if a certificate was in fact verified. There is currently no known workaround.,3.3,CWE-295
