CVE-2023-52504,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()  Fei has reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on a 5-level paging machine:  	BUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching() 	Read of size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0 	... 	__asan_load4() 	rcu_is_watching() 	trace_hardirqs_on() 	text_poke_early() 	apply_alternatives() 	...  On machines with 5-level paging cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57) gets patched. It includes KASAN code where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().  KASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches the KASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START static by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56 works around the issue.  Fix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives.

CVE-2025-22618,WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `adicionar_cargo.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `cargo` parameter.

CVE-2023-52497,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression  Currently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplace decompression that was used to handle the cases that some pages of compressed data are actually not in-place I/O.  However like most simple LZ77 algorithms LZ4 expects the compressed data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and it explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:   __________________________________________________________  |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|  Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this it typically maps two individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain. Previously it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem to completely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reported that EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor. After some analysis it seems that recent x86 processors with the new FSRM feature expose this issue with rep movsb.  Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace decompression for now.  Later as an useful improvement we could try to tie up these two buffers together in the correct order.,6.1,CWE-787

CVE-2023-37470,Metabase is an open-source business intelligence and analytics platform. Prior to versions 0.43.7.3 0.44.7.3 0.45.4.3 0.46.6.4 1.43.7.3 1.44.7.3 1.45.4.3 and 1.46.6.4 a vulnerability could potentially allow remote code execution on one's Metabase server. The core issue is that one of the supported data warehouses (an embedded in-memory database H2) exposes a number of ways for a connection string to include code that is then executed by the process running the embedded database. Because Metabase allows users to connect to databases this means that a user supplied string can be used to inject executable code. Metabase allows users to validate their connection string before adding a database (including on setup) and this validation API was the primary vector used as it can be called without validation. Versions 0.43.7.3 0.44.7.3 0.45.4.3 0.46.6.4 1.43.7.3 1.44.7.3 1.45.4.3 and 1.46.6.4 fix this issue by removing the ability of users to add H2 databases entirely. As a workaround it is possible to block these vulnerabilities at the network level by blocking the endpoints `POST /api/database` `PUT /api/database/:id` and `POST /api/setup/validateuntil`. Those who use H2 as a file-based database should migrate to SQLite.,10.0,CWE-94

CVE-2023-46738,CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A security vulnerability was found in CubeFS HandlerNode in versions prior to 3.3.1 that could allow authenticated users to send maliciously-crafted requests that would crash the ObjectNode and deny other users from using it. The root cause was improper handling of incoming HTTP requests that could allow an attacker to control the ammount of memory that the ObjectNode would allocate. A malicious request could make the ObjectNode allocate more memory that the machine had available and the attacker could exhaust memory by way of a single malicious request. An attacker would need to be authenticated in order to invoke the vulnerable code with their malicious request and have permissions to delete objects. In addition the attacker would need to know the names of existing buckets of the CubeFS deployment - otherwise the request would be rejected before it reached the vulnerable code. As such the most likely attacker is an inside user or an attacker that has breached the account of an existing user in the cluster. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation besides upgrading.,6.5,CWE-770
