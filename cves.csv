CVE-2024-53186,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling  A race condition exists between SMB request handling in `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` and the freeing of `ksmbd_conn` in the workqueue handler `handle_ksmbd_work()`. This leads to a UAF. - KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in handle_ksmbd_work - KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rtlock_slowlock_locked  This race condition arises as follows: - `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` waits for `conn->r_count` to reach zero:   `wait_event(conn->r_count_q atomic_read(&conn->r_count) == 0);` - Meanwhile `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count` using   `atomic_dec_return(&conn->r_count)` and if it reaches zero calls   `ksmbd_conn_free()` which frees `conn`. - However after `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count`   it may still access `conn->r_count_q` in the following line:   `waitqueue_active(&conn->r_count_q)` or `wake_up(&conn->r_count_q)`   This results in a UAF as `conn` has already been freed.  The discovery of this UAF can be referenced in the following PR for syzkaller's support for SMB requests.,7.0,CWE-362

CVE-2024-34347,@hoppscotch/cli is a CLI to run Hoppscotch Test Scripts in CI environments. Prior to 0.8.0 the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.,8.3,CWE-77

Also move it into the loops to have a smaller scope.  Using a u32 there is fine we limit the number of APs in the scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNR entries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scan results a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it's more like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11 we get an upper bound for the number of ~372k well in the bounds of a u32.,5.5,CWE-835
