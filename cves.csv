CVE-2023-28630,GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. In GoCD versions from 20.5.0 and below 23.1.0 if the server environment is not correctly configured by administrators to provide access to the relevant PostgreSQL or MySQL backup tools the credentials for database access may be unintentionally leaked to admin alerts on the GoCD user interface. The vulnerability is triggered only if the GoCD server host is misconfigured to have backups enabled but does not have access to the `pg_dump` or `mysqldump` utility tools to backup the configured database type (PostgreSQL or MySQL respectively). In such cases failure to launch the expected backup utility reports the shell environment used to attempt to launch in the server admin alert which includes the plaintext database password supplied to the configured tool. This vulnerability does not affect backups of the default on-disk H2 database that GoCD is configured to use. This issue has been addressed and fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid use-after-free in ext4_ext_show_leaf()  In ext4_find_extent() path may be freed by error or be reallocated so using a previously saved *ppath may have been freed and thus may trigger use-after-free as follows:  ext4_split_extent   path = *ppath;   ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)   path = ext4_find_extent(ppath)   ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)     // ext4_find_extent fails to free path     // but zeroout succeeds   ext4_ext_show_leaf(inode path)     eh = path[depth].p_hdr     // path use-after-free !!!  Similar to ext4_split_extent_at() we use *ppath directly as an input to ext4_ext_show_leaf(). Fix a spelling error by the way.  Same problem in ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(). Since 'path' is only used in ext4_ext_show_leaf() remove 'path' and use *ppath directly.  This issue is triggered only when EXT_DEBUG is defined and therefore does not affect functionality.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-50196,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts  The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.  ``` for (i = 0; i < info->stride; i++) { 	uregmap_read(info->map id_reg + 4 * i &reg); 	if (!reg) 		continue;  	chained_irq_enter(parent_chip desc); ```  However in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent controller configured in edge mode GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the hardware. In the result if the interrupt is short enough the parent interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared; chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to service the parent interrupt.  Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the hardware.

CVE-2024-43357,ECMA-262 is the language specification for the scripting language ECMAScript. A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators introduced by a May 2021 spec refactor may lead to mis-implementation in a way that could present as a security vulnerability such as type confusion and pointer dereference.  The internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult (`{ done value }`) objects that it creates assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype` so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able triggering arbitrary behaviour including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants.  The ECMAScript specification is a living standard and the issue has been addressed at the time of this advisory's public disclosure. JavaScript engine implementors should refer to the latest specification and update their implementations to comply with the `AsyncGenerator` section.  ## References  - https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/commit/1e24a286d0a327d08e1154926b3ee79820232727 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1901411 - https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/security/advisories/GHSA-f67q-wr6w-23jq - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275407 - https://issues.chromium.org/issues/346692561 - https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7652,8.6,CWE-248

CVE-2024-40648,matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server library in Rust. The `UserIdentity::is_verified()` method in the matrix-sdk-crypto crate before version 0.7.2 doesn't take into account the verification status of the user's own identity while performing the check and may as a result return a value contrary to what is implied by its name and documentation. If the method is used to decide whether to perform sensitive operations towards a user identity a malicious homeserver could manipulate the outcome in order to make the identity appear trusted. This is not a typical usage of the method which lowers the impact. The method itself is not used inside the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate. The 0.7.2 release of the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate includes a fix. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.4,CWE-287

CVE-2023-24813,Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter written in php. Due to the difference in the attribute parser of Dompdf and php-svg-lib an attacker can still call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols. Dompdf parses the href attribute of `image` tags and respects `xlink:href` even if `href` is specified. However php-svg-lib which is later used to parse the svg file parses the href attribute. Since `href` is respected if both `xlink:href` and `href` is specified it's possible to bypass the protection on the Dompdf side by providing an empty `xlink:href` attribute. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols if they provide an SVG file to the Dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0 it leads to arbitrary unserialize which will lead at the very least to arbitrary file deletion and might lead to remote code execution depending on available classes.
