CVE-2024-41091,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tun: add missing verification for short frame  The cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame length in the tun_xdp_one() path which could cause a corrupted skb to be sent downstack. Even before the skb is transmitted the tun_xdp_one-->eth_type_trans() may access the Ethernet header although it can be less than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted this could either cause out-of-bound access beyond the actual length or confuse the underlayer with incorrect or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.  In the alternative path tun_get_user() already prohibits short frame which has the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted for IFF_TAP.  This is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just like how tun_get_user() does.  CVE: CVE-2024-41091,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2022-50379,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix race between quota enable and quota rescan ioctl  When enabling quotas at btrfs_quota_enable() after committing the transaction we change fs_info->quota_root to point to the quota root we created and set BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED at fs_info->flags. Then we try to start the qgroup rescan worker first by initializing it with a call to qgroup_rescan_init() - however if that fails we end up freeing the quota root but we leave fs_info->quota_root still pointing to it this can later result in a use-after-free somewhere else.  We have previously set the flags BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED and BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_ON so we can only fail with -EINPROGRESS at btrfs_quota_enable() which is possible if someone already called the quota rescan ioctl and therefore started the rescan worker.

CVE-2024-43825,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table  The sorting in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table is not working as intended. It could result in an out-of-bounds access when the time is zero.  Here are more details:  1. When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero e.g. the time sequence is `3 0 1` the inner for-loop will not terminate and do out-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new` the value `new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be moved to `j+1` position which makes the if-condition always hold. Meanwhile idx will be added one making the loop keep running without termination and out-of-bound write. 2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero the elements will just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates.  For more details please refer to https://lore.kernel.org/all/6dd0d822-046c-4dd2-9532-79d7ab96ec05@gmail.com.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2024-5263,The ElementsKit Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Motion Text and Table widgets in all versions up to and including 3.6.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.,6.4,CWE-79
CVE-2020-37001,Frigate Professional 3.36.0.9 contains a local buffer overflow vulnerability in the Pack File feature that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by overflowing the 'Archive To' input field. Attackers can craft a malicious payload that overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and uses an egghunter technique to execute a reverse shell payload.,8.4,CWE-121
CVE-2025-58163,FreeScout is a free help desk and shared inbox built with PHP's Laravel framework. Versions 1.8.185 and earlier contain a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability that allows authenticated attackers with knowledge of the application's APP_KEY to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability is exploited via endpoint e.g.: `/help/{mailbox_id}/auth/{customer_id}/{hash}/{timestamp}` where the `customer_id` and `timestamp` parameters are processed through the decrypt function in `app/Helper.php` without proper validation. The code decrypts using Laravel's built-in encryption functions which subsequently deserialize the decrypted payload without sanitization allowing attackers to craft malicious serialized PHP objects using classes to trigger arbitrary command execution. This is fixed in version 1.8.186.,8.8,CWE-502
CVE-2025-64383,Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Qode Qi Blocks qi-blocks allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Qi Blocks: from n/a through <= 1.4.3.,6.5,CWE-79
CVE-2024-30124,HCL Sametime is impacted by insecure services in-use on the UIM client by default. An unused legacy REST service was enabled by default using the HTTP protocol. An attacker could potentially use this service endpoint maliciously.,4.0,CWE-1188
CVE-2023-5175,During process shutdown it was possible that an `ImageBitmap` was created that would later be used after being freed from a different codepath leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 118.,9.8,CWE-416
