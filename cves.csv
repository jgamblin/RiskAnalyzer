CVE-2025-9714,Uncontrolled recursion in XPath evaluation in libxml2 up to and including version 2.9.14 allows a local attacker to cause a stack overflow via crafted expressions. XPath processing functions `xmlXPathRunEval` `xmlXPathCtxtCompile` and `xmlXPathEvalExpr` were resetting recursion depth to zero before making potentially recursive calls. When such functions were called recursively this could allow for uncontrolled recursion and lead to a stack overflow. These functions now preserve recursion depth across recursive calls allowing recursion depth to be controlled.,6.2,CWE-674

CVE-2021-47533,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vc4: kms: Clear the HVS FIFO commit pointer once done  Commit 9ec03d7f1ed3 (drm/vc4: kms: Wait on previous FIFO users before a commit) introduced a wait on the previous commit done on a given HVS FIFO.  However we never cleared that pointer once done. Since drm_crtc_commit_put can free the drm_crtc_commit structure directly if we were the last user this means that it can lead to a use-after free if we were to duplicate the state and that stale pointer would even be copied to the new state.  Set the pointer to NULL once we're done with the wait so that we don't carry over a pointer to a free'd structure.,7.8,CWE-416
CVE-2025-11204,The RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms User Registration Payment and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to and including 6.0.6.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

CVE-2022-23632,Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.6.1 Traefik skips the router transport layer security (TLS) configuration when the host header is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For a request the TLS configuration choice can be different than the router choice which implies the use of a wrong TLS configuration. When sending a request using FQDN handled by a router configured with a dedicated TLS configuration the TLS configuration falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to the configured one. If the CNAME flattening is enabled the selected TLS configuration is the SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value so this can skip the expected TLS configuration. Version 2.6.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround one may add the FDQN to the host rule. However there is no workaround if the CNAME flattening is enabled.,7.4,CWE-295

CVE-2024-42240,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation  When BHI mitigation is enabled if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set then entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the clear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler (exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the entry_SYSENTER_compat() function.  To address this issue entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY after making sure the TF flag is cleared.  The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:    $ cat sysenter_step.c   int main()   { asm(pushf; pop %ax; bts $8%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter); }    $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c    $ ./sysenter_step   Segmentation fault (core dumped)  The program is expected to crash and the #DB handler will issue a warning.

CVE-2021-47218,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails  When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init() h->size is left initialized with a non-zero value but the h->htable pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference since the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed hashtab_init() hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called on it. Yet these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.  Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid empty hashtab when the allocation fails.,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2023-29216,In Apache Linkis <=1.3.1 because the parameters are not effectively filtered the attacker uses the MySQL data source and malicious parameters to configure a new data source to trigger a deserialization vulnerability eventually leading to remote code execution.

CVE-2023-1255,Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer leading to a crash.  Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk encryption.  The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16 byte blocks e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is unmapped this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service.  If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM the application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a Low severity one.,5.9,CWE-125

CVE-2025-62523,PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton. PILOS before 4.8.0 includes a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration in its middleware: it reflects the Origin request header back in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header without proper validation or a whitelist while Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is set to true. This behavior could allow a malicious website on a different origin to send requests (including credentials) to the PILOS API. This may enable exfiltration or actions using the victim’s credentials if the server accepts those cross-origin requests as authenticated. Laravel’s session handling applies additional origin checks such that cross-origin requests are not authenticated by default. Because of these session-origin protections and in the absence of any other unknown vulnerabilities that would bypass Laravel’s origin/session checks this reflected-Origin CORS misconfiguration is not believed to be exploitable in typical PILOS deployments. This vulnerability has been patched in PILOS in v4.8.0,6.3,CWE-942

CVE-2025-40918,Authen::SASL::Perl::DIGEST_MD5 versions 2.04 through 2.1800 for Perl generates the cnonce insecurely.  The cnonce (client nonce) is generated from an MD5 hash of the PID the epoch time and the built-in rand function. The PID will come from a small set of numbers and the epoch time may be guessed if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.  According to RFC 2831 The cnonce-value is an opaque quoted string value provided by the client and used by both client and server to avoid chosen plaintext attacks and to provide mutual authentication. The security of the implementation  depends on a good choice. It is RECOMMENDED that it contain at least 64 bits of entropy.,6.5,CWE-338
