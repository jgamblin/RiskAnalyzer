CVE-2021-47225,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mac80211: fix deadlock in AP/VLAN handling  Syzbot reports that when you have AP_VLAN interfaces that are up and close the AP interface they belong to we get a deadlock. No surprise - since we dev_close() them with the wiphy mutex held which goes back into the netdev notifier in cfg80211 and tries to acquire the wiphy mutex there.  To fix this we need to do two things:  1) prevent changing iftype while AP_VLANs are up we can't     easily fix this case since cfg80211 already calls us with     the wiphy mutex held but change_interface() is relatively     rare in drivers anyway so changing iftype isn't used much     (and userspace has to fall back to down/change/up anyway)  2) pull the dev_close() loop over VLANs out of the wiphy mutex     section in the normal stop case,5.5,CWE-667

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN which is more permissive causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device.

CVE-2022-49326,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtl818x: Prevent using not initialized queues  Using not existing queues can panic the kernel with rtl8180/rtl8185 cards. Ignore the skb priority for those cards they only have one tx queue. Pierre Asselin (pa@panix.com) reported the kernel crash in the Gentoo forum:  https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1147832-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-25.html  He also confirmed that this patch fixes the issue. In summary this happened:  After updating wpa_supplicant from 2.9 to 2.10 the kernel crashed with a divide error: 0000 when connecting to an AP. Control port tx now tries to use IEEE80211_AC_VO for the priority which wpa_supplicants starts to use in 2.10.  Since only the rtl8187se part of the driver supports QoS the priority of the skb is set to IEEE80211_AC_BE (2) by mac80211 for rtl8180/rtl8185 cards.  rtl8180 is then unconditionally reading out the priority and finally crashes on drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl818x/rtl8180/dev.c line 544 without this patch: 	idx = (ring->idx + skb_queue_len(&ring->queue)) % ring->entries  ring->entries is zero for rtl8180/rtl8185 cards tx_ring[2] never got initialized.,5.5,CWE-908

CVE-2024-7457,The ws.stash.app.mac.daemon.helper tool contains a vulnerability caused by an incorrect use of macOS’s authorization model. Instead of validating the client's authorization reference the helper invokes AuthorizationCopyRights() using its own privileged context (root) effectively authorizing itself rather than the client.

CVE-2024-32028,OpenTelemetry dotnet is a dotnet telemetry framework. In affected versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` the `url.full` writes attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming http requests. These attributes are defined by the Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans. Up until version `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information credentials etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents. Note: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability. The `1.8.1` versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will now redact by default all values detected on transmitted or received query strings.
