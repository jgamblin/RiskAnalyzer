CVE-2024-32462,Flatpak is a system for building distributing and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9 1.12.9 1.14.6 and 1.15.8 a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=` such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap` and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap` which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8 1.10.9 1.12.9 and 1.14.6.,8.4,CWE-88

CVE-2022-48890,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: storvsc: Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VM  storvsc_queuecommand() maps the scatter/gather list using scsi_dma_map() which in a confidential VM allocates swiotlb bounce buffers. If the I/O submission fails in storvsc_do_io() the I/O is typically retried by higher level code but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like cause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer which is not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffer memory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problem can arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter swiotlb=force.  Fix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission error which frees the bounce buffer memory.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2022-24765,Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git` which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\.git\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround.

CVE-2022-49312,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: rtl8712: fix a potential memory leak in r871xu_drv_init()  In r871xu_drv_init() if r8712_init_drv_sw() fails then the memory allocated by r8712_alloc_io_queue() in r8712_usb_dvobj_init() is not properly released as there is no action will be performed by r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit(). To properly release it we should call r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit().  Besides in r871xu_dev_remove() r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() will be called by r871x_dev_unload() under condition `padapter->bup` and r8712_free_io_queue() is called by r8712_free_drv_sw(). However r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() does not rely on `padapter->bup` and calling r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_free_drv_sw() is negative for better understading the code. So I move r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() into r871xu_dev_remove() and remove r8712_free_io_queue() from r8712_free_drv_sw().,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2023-39325,A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.,7.5,CWE-770
