CVE-2024-25625,Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. A potential security vulnerability has been discovered in `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4. The vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the `invitationLinkAction` function of the UserController specifically in the way `$loginUrl` trusts user input.  The host header from incoming HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs. An attacker can manipulate the HTTP host header in requests to the /admin/user/invitationlink endpoint resulting in the generation of URLs with the attacker's domain. In fact if a host header is injected in the POST request the $loginURL parameter is constructed with this unvalidated host header. It is then used to send an invitation email to the provided user. This vulnerability can be used to perform phishing attacks by making the URLs in the invitation links emails point to an attacker-controlled domain. Version 1.3.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability. The maintainers recommend validating the host header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It would also be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the incoming host header is not recognized or is absent.,8.1,CWE-74
CVE-2015-1784,In nextgen-galery wordpress plugin before 2.0.77.3 there are two vulnerabilities which can allow an attacker to gain full access over the web application.

CVE-2022-26477,The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable which if tampered with may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix we added an upper bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We classify it as a low-priority but useful improvement. SystemDS is a distributed system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in many code paths (e.g. on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence files) the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints. In this particular case though the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number of columns which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in a consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly improved with almost zero overhead. These code changes are available in versions higher than 2.2.1.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2024-35187,Stalwart Mail Server is an open-source mail server. Prior to version 0.8.0 attackers who achieved Arbitrary Code Execution as the stalwart-mail user (including web interface admins) can gain complete root access to the system. Usually system services are run as a separate user (not as root) to isolate an attacker with Arbitrary Code Execution to the current service. Therefore other system services and the system itself remains protected in case of a successful attack. stalwart-mail runs as a separate user but it can give itself full privileges again in a simple way so this protection is practically ineffective. Server admins who handed out the admin credentials to the mail server but didn't want to hand out complete root access to the system as well as any attacked user when the attackers gained Arbitrary Code Execution using another vulnerability may be vulnerable. Version 0.8.0 contains a patch for the issue.,9.1,CWE-863

CVE-2024-26704,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix double-free of blocks due to wrong extents moved_len  In ext4_move_extents() moved_len is only updated when all moves are successfully executed and only discards orig_inode and donor_inode preallocations when moved_len is not zero. When the loop fails to exit after successfully moving some extents moved_len is not updated and remains at 0 so it does not discard the preallocations.  If the moved extents overlap with the preallocated extents the overlapped extents are freed twice in ext4_mb_release_inode_pa() and ext4_process_freed_data() (as described in commit 94d7c16cbbbd (ext4: Fix double-free of blocks with EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT)) and bb_free is incremented twice. Hence when trim is executed a zero-division bug is triggered in mb_update_avg_fragment_size() because bb_free is not zero and bb_fragments is zero.  Therefore update move_len after each extent move to avoid the issue.,7.8,CWE-415

CVE-2022-41948,DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture management validation analytics and visualization. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A DHIS2 user with authority to manage users can assign superuser privileges to themself by manually crafting an HTTP PUT request. Only users with the following DHIS2 user role authorities can exploit this vulnerability. Note that in many systems the only users with user admin privileges are also superusers. In these cases the escalation vulnerability does not exist. The vulnerability is only exploitable by attackers who can authenticate as users with the user admin authority.  As this is usually a small and relatively trusted set of users exploit vectors will often be limited. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1 2.37.8.1 2.38.2.1 2.39.0.1. The only known workaround to this issue is to avoid the assignment of the user management authority to any users until the patch has been applied.,6.7,CWE-269

CVE-2025-4575,Issue summary: Use of -addreject option with the openssl x509 application adds a trusted use instead of a rejected use for a certificate.  Impact summary: If a user intends to make a trusted certificate rejected for a particular use it will be instead marked as trusted for that use.  A copy & paste error during minor refactoring of the code introduced this issue in the OpenSSL 3.5 version. If for example a trusted CA certificate should be trusted only for the purpose of authenticating TLS servers but not for CMS signature verification and the CMS signature verification is intended to be marked as rejected with the -addreject option the resulting CA certificate will be trusted for CMS signature verification purpose instead.  Only users which use the trusted certificate format who use the openssl x509 command line application to add rejected uses are affected by this issue. The issues affecting only the command line application are considered to be Low severity.  The FIPS modules in 3.5 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  OpenSSL 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are also not affected by this issue.,6.5,CWE-295
