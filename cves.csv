CVE-2025-34263,Advantech WISE-DeviceOn Server versions prior to 5.4 contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the /rmm/v1/plugin-config/dashboards/menus endpoint. When an authenticated user adds or edits a dashboard entry the label and path values are stored in plugin configuration data and later rendered in the dashboard UI without proper HTML sanitation. An attacker can inject malicious script into either field which is then executed in the browser context of users who view or interact with the affected dashboard potentially enabling session compromise and unauthorized actions as the victim.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2024-26162,Microsoft ODBC Driver Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,8.8,CWE-681
CVE-2024-56740,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs/localio: must clear res.replen in nfs_local_read_done  Otherwise memory corruption can occur due to NFSv3 LOCALIO reads leaving garbage in res.replen: - nfs3_read_done() copies that into server->read_hdrsize; from there   nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests. - nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()   which includes it in hdrsize for xdr_init_pages so that rq_rcv_buf   contains a ridiculous len. - This is copied to rq_private_buf and xs_read_stream_request()   eventually passes the kvec to sock_recvmsg() which receives incoming   data into entirely the wrong place.  This is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads when it is made to pivot back to using normal RPC.  This switch back to using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this issue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3 server while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2023-43123,On unix-like systems the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems.  The method File.createTempFile on unix-like systems creates a file with predefined name (so easily identifiable) and by default will create this file with the permissions -rw-r--r--. Thus if sensitive information is written to this file other local users can read this information.  File.createTempFile(String String) will create a temporary file in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir' system property is not explicitly set.   This affects the class  https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TopologySpoutLag.java#L99  and was introduced by  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3123   In practice this has a very limited impact as this class is used only if ui.disable.spout.lag.monitoring   is set to false but its value is true by default. Moreover the temporary file gets deleted soon after its creation.  The solution is to use  Files.createTempFile https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempFile(java.lang.Stringjava.lang.Stringjava.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...)  instead.  We recommend that all users upgrade to the latest version of Apache Storm.,5.5,CWE-200

CVE-2022-49568,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: Don't null dereference ops->destroy  A KVM device cleanup happens in either of two callbacks: 1) destroy() which is called when the VM is being destroyed; 2) release() which is called when a device fd is closed.  Most KVM devices use 1) but Book3s's interrupt controller KVM devices (XICS XIVE XIVE-native) use 2) as they need to close and reopen during the machine execution. The error handling in kvm_ioctl_create_device() assumes destroy() is always defined which leads to NULL dereference as discovered by Syzkaller.  This adds a checks for destroy!=NULL and adds a missing release().  This is not changing kvm_destroy_devices() as devices with defined release() should have been removed from the KVM devices list by then.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-26710,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB  KASAN is seen to increase stack usage to the point that it was reported to lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).  To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in commit 3e8635fb2e07 (powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with KASAN).  However with a 32KB stack size to begin with the doubling leads to a 64KB stack which causes build errors:   arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)  Although the asm could be reworked in practice a 32KB stack seems sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.

CVE-2025-38566,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sunrpc: fix handling of server side tls alerts  Scott Mayhew discovered a security exploit in NFS over TLS in tls_alert_recv() due to its assumption it can read data from the msg iterator's kvec..  kTLS implementation splits TLS non-data record payload between the control message buffer (which includes the type such as TLS aler or TLS cipher change) and the rest of the payload (say TLS alert's level/description) which goes into the msg payload buffer.  This patch proposes to rework how control messages are setup and used by sock_recvmsg().  If no control message structure is setup kTLS layer will read and process TLS data record types. As soon as it encounters a TLS control message it would return an error. At that point NFS can setup a kvec backed msg buffer and read in the control message such as a TLS alert. Msg iterator can advance the kvec pointer as a part of the copy process thus we need to revert the iterator before calling into the tls_alert_recv.,7.5,CWE-754
