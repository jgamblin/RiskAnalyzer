CVE-2024-43407,CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A potential vulnerability has been discovered in CKEditor 4 Code Snippet GeSHi plugin. The vulnerability allowed a reflected XSS attack by exploiting a flaw in the GeSHi syntax highlighter library hosted by the victim. The GeSHi library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4 source files. In a specific scenario an attacker could craft a malicious script that could be executed by sending a request to the GeSHi library hosted on a PHP web server. The GeSHi library is no longer actively maintained. Due to the lack of ongoing support and updates potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with its continued use. To mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security of the CKEditor 4 we have decided to completely remove the GeSHi library as a dependency.

CVE-2024-40945,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu: Return right value in iommu_sva_bind_device()  iommu_sva_bind_device() should return either a sva bond handle or an ERR_PTR value in error cases. Existing drivers (idxd and uacce) only check the return value with IS_ERR(). This could potentially lead to a kernel NULL pointer dereference issue if the function returns NULL instead of an error pointer.  In reality this doesn't cause any problems because iommu_sva_bind_device() only returns NULL when the kernel is not configured with CONFIG_IOMMU_SVA. In this case iommu_dev_enable_feature(dev IOMMU_DEV_FEAT_SVA) will return an error and the device drivers won't call iommu_sva_bind_device() at all.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-24538,Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used since ES6 for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex and themselves can do string interpolation the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. var a = {{.}}) since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1 with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.,9.8,CWE-94
CVE-2023-27487,Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0 1.25.3 1.24.4 1.23.6 and 1.22.9 the client may bypass JSON Web Token (JWT) checks and forge fake original paths. The header `x-envoy-original-path` should be an internal header but Envoy does not remove this header from the request at the beginning of request processing when it is sent from an untrusted client. The faked header would then be used for trace logs and grpc logs as well as used in the URL used for `jwt_authn` checks if the `jwt_authn` filter is used and any other upstream use of the x-envoy-original-path header. Attackers may forge a trusted `x-envoy-original-path` header. Versions 1.26.0 1.25.3 1.24.4 1.23.6 and 1.22.9 have patches for this issue.,8.2,CWE-20

CVE-2022-31043,Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed only changes to the host. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach which would be to use their own redirect middleware. Alternately users may simply disable redirects all together if redirects are not expected or required.,7.5,CWE-200

CVE-2024-42316,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()  evict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through page writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass since folio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the isolation.  The second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting scan_control->nr_scanned.  However this can result in underflow of nr_scanned under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment nr_scanned i.e. when folio_trylock() fails.  The underflow can cause the divisor i.e. scale=scanned+reclaimed in vmpressure_calc_level() to become zero resulting in the following crash:    [exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101]   process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b  Since scan_control->nr_scanned has no established semantics the potential double counting has minimal risks.

CVE-2021-47333,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge  There is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function. A device might be attached to root complex directly in this case bus->self(bridge) will be NULL thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL. Since alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's ASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off which will be used later by alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device what we can do here is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex. This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply return when bring called effectively disable ASPM for the device.

CVE-2023-42809,Redisson is a Java Redis client that uses the Netty framework. Prior to version 3.22.0 some of the messages received from the Redis server contain Java objects that the client deserializes without further validation. Attackers that manage to trick clients into communicating with a malicious server can include especially crafted objects in its responses that once deserialized by the client force it to execute arbitrary code. This can be abused to take control of the machine the client is running in. Version 3.22.0 contains a patch for this issue.  Some post-fix advice is available. Do NOT use `Kryo5Codec` as deserialization codec as it is still vulnerable to arbitrary object deserialization due to the `setRegistrationRequired(false)` call. On the contrary `KryoCodec` is safe to use. The fix applied to `SerializationCodec` only consists of adding an optional allowlist of class names even though making this behavior the default is recommended. When instantiating `SerializationCodec` please use the `SerializationCodec(ClassLoader classLoader Set<String> allowedClasses)` constructor to restrict the allowed classes for deserialization.,9.6,CWE-502
