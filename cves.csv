CVE-2022-31113,Canarytokens is an open source tool which helps track activity and actions on your network. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens. This permits an attacker who recognised an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the Canarytoken's creator. This vulnerability could be used to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken or view its activation history.

CVE-2025-25305,Home Assistant Core is an open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0 this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True` which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.1.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.0,CWE-940

CVE-2022-39248,matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow for example to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.,8.6,CWE-287

This means Python libraries can be used to make HTTP requests from a browser or Node.js. Additionally urllib3 provides a mechanism to control redirects but the retries and redirect parameters are ignored with Pyodide; the runtime itself determines redirect behavior. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.0.,5.3,CWE-601

CVE-2024-41012,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected  When fcntl_setlk() races with close() it removes the created lock with do_lock_file_wait(). However LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock. Separately posix_lock_file() could also fail to remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range in the middle).  After the bug has been triggered use-after-free reads will occur in lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used to read arbitrary kernel memory but can't corrupt kernel memory.  Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead which is designed to reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and files_struct and is also used by filp_flush().,6.3,CWE-416

CVE-2024-50196,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: ocelot: fix system hang on level based interrupts  The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.  ``` for (i = 0; i < info->stride; i++) { 	uregmap_read(info->map id_reg + 4 * i &reg); 	if (!reg) 		continue;  	chained_irq_enter(parent_chip desc); ```  However in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent controller configured in edge mode GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the hardware. In the result if the interrupt is short enough the parent interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt is cleared; chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to service the parent interrupt.  Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for loop ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the hardware.  The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions wrapping interrupt checking loop may be found in many other drivers: ``` grep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl ```,5.5,CWE-754

CVE-2024-43804,Roxy-WI is a web interface for managing Haproxy Nginx Apache and Keepalived servers. An OS Command Injection vulnerability allows any authenticated user on the application to execute arbitrary code on the web application server via port scanning functionality. User-supplied input is used without validation when constructing and executing an OS command. User supplied JSON POST data is parsed and if id JSON key does not exist JSON value supplied via ip JSON key is assigned to the ip variable. Later on ip variable which can be controlled by the attacker is used when constructing the cmd and cmd1 strings without any extra validation. Then server_mod.subprocess_execute function is called on both cmd1 and cmd2. When the definition of the server_mod.subprocess_execute() function is analyzed it can be seen that subprocess.Popen() is called on the input parameter with shell=True which results in OS Command Injection.

CVE-2024-9683,A vulnerability was found in Quay which allows successful authentication even when a truncated password version is provided. This flaw affects the authentication mechanism reducing the overall security of password enforcement.  While the risk is relatively low due to the typical length of the passwords used (73 characters) this vulnerability can still be exploited to reduce the complexity of brute-force or password-guessing attacks. The truncation of passwords weakens the overall authentication process thereby reducing the effectiveness of password policies and potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access in the future.,4.8,CWE-305

CVE-2024-47757,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential oob read in nilfs_btree_check_delete()  The function nilfs_btree_check_delete() which checks whether degeneration to direct mapping occurs before deleting a b-tree entry causes memory access outside the block buffer when retrieving the maximum key if the root node has no entries.  This does not usually happen because b-tree mappings with 0 child nodes are never created by mkfs.nilfs2 or nilfs2 itself.
