CVE-2025-29913,CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted telecommand (TC) frame that causes an unsigned integer underflow. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`.,9.8,CWE-125

CVE-2024-56700,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: wl128x: Fix atomicity violation in fmc_send_cmd()  Atomicity violation occurs when the fmc_send_cmd() function is executed simultaneously with the modification of the fmdev->resp_skb value. Consider a scenario where after passing the validity check within the function a non-null fmdev->resp_skb variable is assigned a null value. This results in an invalid fmdev->resp_skb variable passing the validity check. As seen in the later part of the function skb = fmdev->resp_skb; when the invalid fmdev->resp_skb passes the check a null pointer dereference error may occur at line 478 evt_hdr = (void *)skb->data;  To address this issue it is recommended to include the validity check of fmdev->resp_skb within the locked section of the function. This modification ensures that the value of fmdev->resp_skb does not change during the validation process thereby maintaining its validity.  This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool developed by our team. This tool analyzes the locking APIs to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed and then analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible concurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-38620,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  zloop: fix KASAN use-after-free of tag set  When a zoned loop device or zloop device is removed KASAN enabled kernel reports BUG KASAN use-after-free in blk_mq_free_tag_set(). The BUG happens because zloop_ctl_remove() calls put_disk() which invokes zloop_free_disk(). The zloop_free_disk() frees the memory allocated for the zlo pointer. However after the memory is freed zloop_ctl_remove() calls blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set) which accesses the freed zlo. Hence the KASAN use-after-free.   zloop_ctl_remove()   put_disk(zlo->disk)    put_device()     kobject_put()      ...       zloop_free_disk()         kvfree(zlo)   blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set)  To avoid the BUG move the call to blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set) from zloop_ctl_remove() into zloop_free_disk(). This ensures that the tag_set is freed before the call to kvfree(zlo).,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-39199,immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. immudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish between different server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep the state for multiple servers. SDK does not validate this uuid and can accept any value reported by the server. A malicious server can change the reported UUID tricking the client to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state completely irrelevant to the one previously retrieved from the server. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1. As a workaround when initializing an immudb client object a custom state handler can be used to store the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores the server UUID can be used to ensure that even if the server changes the UUID client will still consider it to be the same server.,5.8,CWE-345

CVE-2025-49928,Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in CrocoBlock JetWooBuilder jet-woo-builder allows DOM-Based XSS.This issue affects JetWooBuilder: from n/a through <= 2.1.20.,6.5,CWE-79
CVE-2024-10957,The UpdraftPlus: WP Backup & Migration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions from 1.23.8 to 1.24.11 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'recursive_unserialized_replace' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files retrieve sensitive data or execute code depending on the POP chain present. An administrator must perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit.,8.8,CWE-502
