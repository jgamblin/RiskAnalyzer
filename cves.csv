CVE-2024-4536,In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2 in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) an attacker might obtain OAuth2 client secrets from the vault.  In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2 we have identified a security vulnerability in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) regarding the OAuth2-protected data sink feature. When using a custom OAuth2-protected data sink the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically the consumer-provided clientSecretKey which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault is resolved in the context of the provider's vault not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl also consumer-controlled as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.  This feature is now disabled entirely because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.  ,6.8,CWE-201

CVE-2021-47281,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()  The timer instance per queue is exclusive and snd_seq_timer_open() should have managed the concurrent accesses.  It looks as if it's checking the already existing timer instance at the beginning but it's not right because there is no protection hence any later concurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timer instance easily.  This may result in UAF as the leftover timer instance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed as spotted by syzkaller recently.  For avoiding the race add a proper check at the assignment of tmr->timeri again and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.,7.0,CWE-416

CVE-2023-50715,Home Assistant is open source home automation software. Prior to version 2023.12.3 the login page discloses all active user accounts to any unauthenticated browsing request originating on the Local Area Network. Version 2023.12.3 contains a patch for this issue.  When starting the Home Assistant 2023.12 release the login page returns all currently active user accounts to browsing requests from the Local Area Network. Tests showed that this occurs when the request is not authenticated and the request originated locally meaning on the Home Assistant host local subnet or any other private subnet. The rationale behind this is to make the login more user-friendly and an experience better aligned with other applications that have multiple user-profiles.  However as a result all accounts are displayed regardless of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to the server. This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for requests originating from a LAN address. But note that this applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant resides and to any private subnet that can reach it.,4.3,CWE-200

CVE-2024-34347,@hoppscotch/cli is a CLI to run Hoppscotch Test Scripts in CI environments. Prior to 0.8.0 the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.,8.3,CWE-77

CVE-2024-43856,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dma: fix call order in dmam_free_coherent  dmam_free_coherent() frees a DMA allocation which makes the freed vaddr available for reuse then calls devres_destroy() to remove and free the data structure used to track the DMA allocation. Between the two calls it is possible for a concurrent task to make an allocation with the same vaddr and add it to the devres list.  If this happens there will be two entries in the devres list with the same vaddr and devres_destroy() can free the wrong entry triggering the WARN_ON() in dmam_match.  Fix by destroying the devres entry before freeing the DMA allocation.    kokonut //net/encryption     http://sponge2/b9145fe6-0f72-4325-ac2f-a84d81075b03,5.5,CWE-770

CVE-2023-26481,authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Due to an insufficient access check a recovery flow link that is created by an admin (or sent via email by an admin) can be used to set the password for any arbitrary user. This attack is only possible if a recovery flow exists which has both an Identification and an Email stage bound to it. If the flow has policies on the identification stage to skip it when the flow is restored (by checking `request.context['is_restored']`) the flow is not affected by this. With this flow in place an administrator must create a recovery Link or send a recovery URL to the attacker who can due to the improper validation of the token create set the password for any account. Regardless for custom recovery flows it is recommended to add a policy that checks if the flow is restored and skips the identification stage. This issue has been fixed in versions 2023.2.3 2023.1.3 and 2022.12.2. ,9.1,CWE-345
CVE-2024-24827,Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb` `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb` `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server.,5.3,CWE-400

CVE-2025-23031,WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `adicionar_alergia.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `nome` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `adicionar_alergia.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts which are then stored on the server.

CVE-2024-43412,Xibo is an open source digital signage platform with a web content management system (CMS). Prior to version 4.1.0 a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Xibo CMS allows authorized users to execute arbitrary JavaScript via the file preview function. Users can upload HTML/CSS/JS files into the Xibo Library via the Generic File module to be referenced on Displays and in Layouts. This is intended functionality. When previewing these resources from the Library and Layout editor they are executed in the users browser. This will be disabled in future releases and users are encouraged to use the new developer tools in 4.1 to design their widgets which require this type of functionality. This behavior has been changed in 4.1.0 to preview previewing of generic files. There are no workarounds for this issue.,4.6,CWE-79
CVE-2022-29167,Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response covering the HTTP method request URI host and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`) which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port` those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.,7.4,CWE-400
CVE-2023-38116,Foxit PDF Reader Doc Object Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of Doc objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-21292.,3.3,CWE-125
