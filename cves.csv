CVE-2024-22423,yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The patch that addressed CVE-2023-40581 attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes. However this escaping is not sufficient and still allows expansion of environment variables. Support for output template expansion in `--exec` along with this vulnerable behavior was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. It replaces them with `%%cd:~%` a variable that expands to nothing leaving only the leading percent. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also always be careful when using `--exec` because while this specific vulnerability has been patched using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath); if expansion in `--exec` is needed verify the fields you are using do not contain `` `|` or `&`; and/or instead of using `--exec` write the info json and load the fields from it instead.,8.3,CWE-78

CVE-2025-5953,The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization in the ajax_insert_employee() and update_empoyee() functions in versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.17. The AJAX handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['role'] and after basic cleaning via hrm_clean() passes it directly to wp_insert_user() and later to $user->set_role() without verifying that the current user is allowed to assign that role. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Employee-level access and above to elevate their privileges to administrator.,8.8,CWE-862

CVE-2023-31134,Tauri is software for building applications for multi-platform deployment. The Tauri IPC is usually strictly isolated from external websites but in versions 1.0.0 until 1.0.9 1.1.0 until 1.1.4 and 1.2.0 until 1.2.5 the isolation can be bypassed by redirecting an existing Tauri window to an external website. This is either possible by an application implementing a feature for users to visit arbitrary websites or due to a bug allowing the open redirect. This allows the external website access to the IPC layer and therefore to all configured and exposed Tauri API endpoints and application specific implemented Tauri commands. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.9 1.1.4 and 1.2.5. As a workaround prevent arbitrary input in redirect features and/or only allow trusted websites access to the IPC.,4.8,CWE-601

CVE-2022-24713,regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2022-46156,The Synthetic Monitoring Agent for Grafana's Synthetic Monitoring application provides probe functionality and executes network checks for monitoring remote targets. Users running the Synthetic Monitoring agent prior to version 0.12.0 in their local network are impacted. The authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic Monitoring API is exposed through a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to retrieve the Synthetic Monitoring checks created by the user and assigned to the agent identified with that token. The Synthetic Monitoring API will reject connections from already-connected agents so access to the token does not guarantee access to the checks. Version 0.12.0 contains a fix. Users are advised to rotate the agent tokens. After upgrading to version v0.12.0 or later it's recommended that users of distribution packages review the configuration stored in `/etc/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-monitoring-agent.conf` specifically the `API_TOKEN` variable which has been renamed to `SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN`. As a workaround for previous versions it's recommended that users review the agent settings and set the HTTP listening address in a manner that limits the exposure for example localhost or a non-routed network by using the command line parameter `-listen-address` e.g. `-listen-address localhost:4050`.,7.2,CWE-489

CVE-2023-32680,Metabase is an open source business analytics engine. To edit SQL Snippets Metabase should have required people to be in at least one group with native query editing permissions to a database–but affected versions of Metabase didn't enforce that requirement. This lack of enforcement meant that: Anyone–including people in sandboxed groups–could edit SQL snippets. They could edit snippets via the API or in the application UI when editing the metadata for a model based on a SQL question and people in sandboxed groups could edit a SQL snippet used in a query that creates their sandbox. If the snippet contained logic that restricted which data that person could see they could potentially edit that snippet and change their level of data access. The permissions model for SQL snippets has been fixed in Metabase versions 0.46.3 0.45.4 0.44.7 1.46.3 1.45.4 and 1.44.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that SQL queries used to create sandboxes exclude SQL snippets.,5.8,CWE-306

CVE-2023-37274,Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. When Auto-GPT is executed directly on the host system via the provided run.sh or run.bat files custom Python code execution is sandboxed using a temporary dedicated docker container which should not have access to any files outside of the Auto-GPT workspace directory. Before v0.4.3 the `execute_python_code` command (introduced in v0.4.1) does not sanitize the `basename` arg before writing LLM-supplied code to a file with an LLM-supplied name. This allows for a path traversal attack that can overwrite any .py file outside the workspace directory by specifying a `basename` such as `../../../main.py`. This can further be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution on the host running Auto-GPT by e.g. overwriting autogpt/main.py which will be executed outside of the docker environment meant to sandbox custom python code execution the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3. As a workaround the risk introduced by this vulnerability can be remediated by running Auto-GPT in a virtual machine or another environment in which damage to files or corruption of the program is not a critical problem.,7.5,CWE-94
CVE-2022-1922,DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using zlib decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in gst_matroska_decompress_data function which causes a segfault or could cause a heap overwrite depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used and the underlying OS capabilities it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks and the OS supports mmap then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc then this could result in a heap overwrite.,7.8,CWE-122
