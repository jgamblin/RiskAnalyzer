CVE-2024-26721,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/dsc: Fix the macro that calculates DSCC_/DSCA_ PPS reg address  Commit bd077259d0a9 (drm/i915/vdsc: Add function to read any PPS register) defines a new macro to calculate the DSC PPS register addresses with PPS number as an input. This macro correctly calculates the addresses till PPS 11 since the addresses increment by 4. So in that case the following macro works correctly to give correct register address:  _MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4)  However after PPS 11 the register address for PPS 12 increments by 12 because of RC Buffer memory allocation in between. Because of this discontinuity in the address space the macro calculates wrong addresses for PPS 12 - 16 resulting into incorrect DSC PPS parameter value read/writes causing DSC corruption.  This fixes it by correcting this macro to add the offset of 12 for PPS >=12.  v3: Add correct paranthesis for pps argument (Jani Nikula)  (cherry picked from commit 6074be620c31dc2ae11af96a1a5ea95580976fb5),5.5,CWE-131

CVE-2024-31991,Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0 the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server. Based on the content of the response it will either parse the content or disregard it. This function nor those that call it add any restrictions on the URL that can be provided nor is it restricted to being an FQDN (i.e. an IP address can be provided). As this function’s return will be handled differently by its caller depending on the response it is possible for an attacker to use this functionality to positively identify HTTP(s) servers on the local network with any IP/port combination. This issue can result in any authenticated user being able to map HTTP servers on a local network that the Mealie service has access to. Note that by default any user can create an account on a Mealie server and that the default changeme@example.com user is available with its hard-coded password. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.,4.1,CWE-918

CVE-2022-39343,Azure RTOS FileX is a FAT-compatible file system that’s fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. In versions before 6.2.0 the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations.

CVE-2025-27092,GHOSTS is an open source user simulation framework for cyber experimentation simulation training and exercise. A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0 that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo retrieval endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint which is designed to serve profile photos for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) but fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths. When an NPC is created with a specially crafted photoLink value containing path traversal sequences (../ ..\ etc.) the application processes these sequences without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files outside of the intended photo directory potentially exposing sensitive system files. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process which could include configuration files credentials or other sensitive data. This issue has been addressed in version 8.2.7.90 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.5,CWE-22

CVE-2023-45683,github.com/crewjam/saml is a saml library for the go language. In affected versions the package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML binding being parsed. If abused this flaw allows attackers to register malicious Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently an attacker may perform any authenticated action as the victim once the victim’s browser loaded the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider. Note: SP registration is commonly an unrestricted operation in IdPs hence not requiring particular permissions or publicly accessible to ease the IdP interoperability. This issue is fixed in version 0.4.14. Users unable to upgrade may perform external validation of URLs provided in SAML metadata or restrict the ability for end-users to upload arbitrary metadata.,7.1,CWE-79

CVE-2021-4314,It is possible to manipulate the JWT token without the knowledge of the JWT secret and authenticate without valid JWT token as any user. This is happening only in the situation when zOSMF doesn’t have the APAR PH12143 applied. This issue affects: 1.16 versions to 1.19. What happens is that the services using the ZAAS client or the API ML API to query will be deceived into believing the information in the JWT token is valid when it isn’t. It’s possible to use this to persuade the southbound service that different user is authenticated.,5.3,CWE-269

CVE-2024-52338,Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in the Apache Arrow R package versions 4.0.0 through 16.1.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it  reads Arrow IPC Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for  example user-supplied input files). This vulnerability only affects the arrow R package not other Apache Arrow  implementations or bindings unless those bindings are specifically used via the R package (for example an R application that embeds a Python interpreter and uses PyArrow to read files from untrusted sources is still vulnerable if the arrow R package is an affected version). It is recommended that users of the arrow R package upgrade to 17.0.0 or later. Similarly it  is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency  requirements to arrow 17.0.0 or later. If using an affected version of the package untrusted data can read into a Table and its internal to_data_frame() method can be used as a workaround (e.g. read_parquet(... as_data_frame = FALSE)$to_data_frame()).   This issue affects the Apache Arrow R package: from 4.0.0 through 16.1.0.   Users are recommended to upgrade to version 17.0.0 which fixes the issue.,9.8,CWE-502
