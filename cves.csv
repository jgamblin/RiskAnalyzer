CVE-2025-62430,ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. ClipBucket v5 through build 5.5.2 #145 allows stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in multiple video and photo metadata fields. For videos the Tags field and the Genre Actors Producer Executive Producer and Director fields in Movieinfos accept user supplied values without adequate sanitization. For photos the Photo Title and Photo Tags fields accept user supplied values without adequate sanitization.

The injected script executes when any user including an unauthenticated visitor or an administrator views the affected video or photo page. Although cookies are set with the HttpOnly attribute and cannot be read directly the injected script can issue fetch requests to endpoints such as admin_area pages and exfiltrate their contents or trigger unintended actions. Version 5.5.2 build #146 and later contain a fix. Update to build 5.5.2 #146 or later. No known workarounds exist.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2022-24778,The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4 a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.,7.5,CWE-863

CVE-2022-50091,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  locking/csd_lock: Change csdlock_debug from early_param to __setup  The csdlock_debug kernel-boot parameter is parsed by the early_param() function csdlock_debug().  If set csdlock_debug() invokes static_branch_enable() to enable csd_lock_wait feature which triggers a panic on arm64 for kernels built with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y and CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n.  With CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n __nr_to_section is called in static_key_enable() and returns NULL resulting in a NULL dereference because mem_section is initialized only later in sparse_init().  This is also a problem for powerpc because early_param() functions are invoked earlier than jump_label_init() also resulting in static_key_enable() failures.  These failures cause the warning static key 'xxx' used before call to jump_label_init().  Thus early_param is too early for csd_lock_wait to run static_branch_enable() so changes it to __setup to fix these.,5.5,CWE-476

This leads to the following problem when the pimary device is not VGA compatible:  1. A PCI device with a non-VGA class is the boot display 2. That device is probed first and it is not a VGA device so    sysfb_disable() is not called but the device resources    are freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() 3.

NULL pointer dereference via sysfb_disable() since the resources    have already been freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() when    it was called by the other device.  Fix this by passing a device pointer to sysfb_disable() and checking the device to determine if we should execute it or not.  v2: Fix build when CONFIG_SCREEN_INFO is not set v3: Move device check into the mutex     Drop primary variable in aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices()     Drop __init on pci sysfb_pci_dev_is_enabled(),5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-7457,The ws.stash.app.mac.daemon.helper tool contains a vulnerability caused by an incorrect use of macOS’s authorization model. Instead of validating the client's authorization reference the helper invokes AuthorizationCopyRights() using its own privileged context (root) effectively authorizing itself rather than the client. As a result it grants the system.preferences.admin right internally regardless of the requesting client's privileges. This flawed logic allows unprivileged clients to invoke privileged operations via XPC including unauthorized changes to system-wide network preferences such as SOCKS HTTP and HTTPS proxy settings. The absence of proper code-signing checks further enables arbitrary processes to exploit this flaw leading to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through traffic redirection.,7.8,CWE-863

It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. Once the content of the URI is read it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message) thereby exposing the file contents.
