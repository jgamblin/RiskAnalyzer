CVE-2024-40647,sentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentry's Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Python's `subprocess` calls all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default) this expectation is not fulfilled and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However if it's not possible and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you you can disable all default integrations. ,5.3,CWE-200

CVE-2024-21545,Proxmox Virtual Environment is an open-source server management platform for enterprise virtualization. Insufficient safeguards against malicious API response values allow authenticated attackers with 'Sys.Audit' or 'VM.Monitor' privileges to download arbitrary host files via the API. When handling the result from a request handler before returning it to the user the handle_api2_request function will check for the ‘download’ or ‘data’->’download’ objects inside the request handler call response object. If present handle_api2_request will read a local file defined by this object and return it to the user. Two endpoints were identified which can control the object returned by a request handler sufficiently that the ’download’ object is defined and user controlled. This results in arbitrary file read. The privileges of this file read can result in full compromise of the system by various impacts such as disclosing sensitive files allowing for privileged session forgery.,8.2,CWE-73

CVE-2024-35804,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: Mark target gfn of emulated atomic instruction as dirty  When emulating an atomic access on behalf of the guest mark the target gfn dirty if the CMPXCHG by KVM is attempted and doesn't fault.  This fixes a bug where KVM effectively corrupts guest memory during live migration by writing to guest memory without informing userspace that the page is dirty.  Marking the page dirty got unintentionally dropped when KVM's emulated CMPXCHG was converted to do a user access.  Before that KVM explicitly mapped the guest page into kernel memory and marked the page dirty during the unmap phase.  Mark the page dirty even if the CMPXCHG fails as the old data is written back on failure i.e. the page is still written.  The value written is guaranteed to be the same because the operation is atomic but KVM's ABI is that all writes are dirty logged regardless of the value written.  And more importantly that's what KVM did before the buggy commit.  Huge kudos to the folks on the Cc list (and many others) who did all the actual work of triaging and debugging.  base-commit: 6769ea8da8a93ed4630f1ce64df6aafcaabfce64,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2021-45492,In Sage 300 ERP (formerly accpac) through 6.8.x the installer configures the C:\Sage\Sage300\Runtime directory to be the first entry in the system-wide PATH environment variable. However this directory is writable by unprivileged users because the Sage installer fails to set explicit permissions and therefore inherits weak permissions from the C:\ folder. Because entries in the system-wide PATH variable are included in the search order for DLLs an attacker could perform DLL search-order hijacking to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM. Furthermore if the Global Search or Web Screens functionality is enabled then privilege escalation is possible via the GlobalSearchService and Sage.CNA.WindowsService services again via DLL search-order hijacking because unprivileged users would have modify permissions on the application directory. Note that while older versions of the software default to installing in %PROGRAMFILES(X86)% (which would allow the Sage folder to inherit strong permissions making the installation not vulnerable) the official Sage 300 installation guides for those versions recommend installing in C:\Sage which would make the installation vulnerable.,7.8,CWE-732

CVE-2025-29769,libvips is a demand-driven horizontally threaded image processing library.  The heifsave operation could incorrectly determine the presence of an alpha channel in an input when it was not possible to determine the colour interpretation known internally within libvips as multiband. There aren't many ways to create a multiband input but it is possible with a well-crafted TIFF image. If a multiband TIFF input image had 4 channels and HEIF-based output was requested this led to libvips creating a 3 channel HEIF image without an alpha channel but then attempting to write 4 channels of data. This caused a heap buffer overflow which could crash the process. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.16.1.,5.5,CWE-122

CVE-2025-38027,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: max20086: fix invalid memory access  max20086_parse_regulators_dt() calls of_regulator_match() using an array of struct of_regulator_match allocated on the stack for the matches argument.  of_regulator_match() calls devm_of_regulator_put_matches() which calls devres_alloc() to allocate a struct devm_of_regulator_matches which will be de-allocated using devm_of_regulator_put_matches().  struct devm_of_regulator_matches is populated with the stack allocated matches array.  If the device fails to probe devm_of_regulator_put_matches() will be called and will try to call of_node_put() on that stack pointer generating the following dmesg entries:  max20086 6-0028: Failed to read DEVICE_ID reg: -121 kobject: '\xc0$\xa5\x03' (000000002cebcb7a): is not initialized yet kobject_put() is being called.  Followed by a stack trace matching the call flow described above.  Switch to allocating the matches array using devm_kcalloc() to avoid accessing the stack pointer long after it's out of scope.  This also has the advantage of allowing multiple max20086 to probe without overriding the data stored inside the global of_regulator_match.,7.1,CWE-125
