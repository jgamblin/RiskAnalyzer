CVE-2023-0296,The Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers flaw (CVE-2016-2183) was reported for the health checks port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy component. Even though the CVE-2016-2183 has been fixed in the etcd components to enable periodic health checks from kubelet it was necessary to open up a new port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy hence this port might be considered as still vulnerable to the same type of vulnerability. The health checks on etcd grpc-proxy do not contain sensitive data (only metrics data) therefore the potential impact related to this vulnerability is minimal. The CVE-2023-0296 has been assigned to this issue to track the permanent fix in the etcd component.,5.3,CWE-327

CVE-2023-46842,Unlike 32-bit PV guests HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit and other modes.  This in particular means that they may set registers used to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range 32-bit code would be able to set them to.  When processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time the hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so involves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective registers.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves a certain amount of translation of the values.  Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a hypercall.  When this is found not to be the case it triggers a consistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash. ,6.5,CWE-843

CVE-2023-29201,XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The restricted mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1 only escaped `<script>` and `<style>`-tags but neither attributes that can be used to inject scripts nor other dangerous HTML tags like `<iframe>`. As a consequence any code relying on this restricted mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (cross-site scripting/XSS). When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights impacting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6 RC1 with the introduction of a filter with allowed HTML elements and attributes that is enabled in restricted mode. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.,9.0,CWE-79

CVE-2025-20127,A vulnerability in the TLS 1.3 implementation for a specific cipher for Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 3100 and 4200 Series devices could allow an authenticated remote attacker to consume resources that are associated with incoming TLS 1.3 connections which eventually could cause the device to stop accepting any new SSL/TLS or VPN requests.    This vulnerability is due to the implementation of the TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.

CVE-2024-31999,@festify/secure-session creates a secure stateless cookie session for Fastify. At the end of the request handling it will encrypt all data in the session with a secret key and attach the ciphertext as a cookie value with the defined cookie name. After that the session on the server side is destroyed. When an encrypted cookie with matching session name is provided with subsequent requests it will decrypt the ciphertext to get the data. The plugin then creates a new session with the data in the ciphertext. Thus theoretically the web instance is still accessing the data from a server-side session but technically that session is generated solely from a user provided cookie (which is assumed to be non-craftable because it is encrypted with a secret key not known to the user). The issue exists in the session removal process. In the delete function of the code when the session is deleted it is marked for deletion. However if an attacker could gain access to the cookie they could keep using it forever. Version 7.3.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround one may include a last update field in the session and treat old sessions as expired.,7.4,CWE-613

CVE-2024-52598,2FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate their security codes. Two interconnected vulnerabilities exist in version 5.4.1 a SSRF and URI validation bypass issue. The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally the library does some basic validation on the URI attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application as long as their content type is text based. If not the request is still sent but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.,7.5,CWE-79

Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access data breaches or other detrimental impacts depending on the privileges of the process executing the code.,9.8,CWE-78
CVE-2022-0866,This is a concurrency issue that can result in the wrong caller principal being returned from the session context of an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal. In particular the org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.EJBComponent class has an incomingRunAsIdentity field. This field is used by the org.jboss.as.ejb3.security.RunAsPrincipalInterceptor to keep track of the current identity prior to switching to a new identity created using the RunAs principal. The exploit consist that the EJBComponent#incomingRunAsIdentity field is currently just a SecurityIdentity. This means in a concurrent environment where multiple users are repeatedly invoking an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal it's possible for the wrong the caller principal to be returned from EJBComponent#getCallerPrincipal. Similarly it's also possible for EJBComponent#isCallerInRole to return the wrong value. Both of these methods rely on incomingRunAsIdentity. Affects all versions of JBoss EAP from 7.1.0 and all versions of WildFly 11+ when Elytron is enabled.,5.3,CWE-863
