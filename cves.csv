CVE-2023-27495,@fastify/csrf-protection is a plugin which helps protect Fastify servers against CSRF attacks. The CSRF protection enforced by the @fastify/csrf-protection library in combination with @fastify/cookie can be bypassed from network and same-site attackers under certain conditions. @fastify/csrf-protection supports an optional userInfo parameter that binds the CSRF token to the user. This parameter has been introduced to prevent cookie-tossing attacks as a fix for CVE-2021-29624. Whenever userInfo parameter is missing or its value can be predicted for the target user account network and same-site attackers can 1. fixate a _csrf cookie in the victim's browser and 2. forge CSRF tokens that are valid for the victim's session. This allows attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism. As a fix @fastify/csrf-protection starting from version 6.3.0 (and v4.1.0) includes a server-defined secret hmacKey that cryptographically binds the CSRF token to the value of the _csrf cookie and the userInfo parameter making tokens non-spoofable by attackers. This protection is effective as long as the userInfo parameter is unique for each user. This is patched in versions 6.3.0 and v4.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use a random non-predictable userInfo parameter for each user as a mitigation.,5.3,CWE-352

CVE-2022-49655,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fscache: Fix invalidation/lookup race  If an NFS file is opened for writing and closed fscache_invalidate() will be asked to invalidate the file - however if the cookie is in the LOOKING_UP state (or the CREATING state) then request to invalidate doesn't get recorded for fscache_cookie_state_machine() to do something with.  Fix this by making __fscache_invalidate() set a flag if it sees the cookie is in the LOOKING_UP state to indicate that we need to go to invalidation. Note that this requires a count on the n_accesses counter for the state machine which that will release when it's done.  fscache_cookie_state_machine() then shifts to the INVALIDATING state if it sees the flag.

CVE-2022-49425,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  f2fs: fix dereference of stale list iterator after loop body  The list iterator variable will be a bogus pointer if no break was hit. Dereferencing it (cur->page in this case) could load an out-of-bounds/undefined value making it unsafe to use that in the comparision to determine if the specific element was found.  Since 'cur->page' *can* be out-ouf-bounds it cannot be guaranteed that by chance (or intention of an attacker) it matches the value of 'page' even though the correct element was not found.  This is fixed by using a separate list iterator variable for the loop and only setting the original variable if a suitable element was found. Then determing if the element was found is simply checking if the variable is set.,5.5,CWE-476

In this example the rss lock would be destroyed by the device unregistration path before being used again but in general running ethnl operations while dismantle has started is not a good idea.  Fix this by denying any operation on devices being unregistered. A check was already there in ethnl_ops_begin but not wide enough.  Note that the same issue cannot be seen on the ioctl version (__dev_ethtool) because the device reference is retrieved from within the rtnl lock section there. Once dismantle started the net device is unlisted and no reference will be found.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2022-49989,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/privcmd: fix error exit of privcmd_ioctl_dm_op()  The error exit of privcmd_ioctl_dm_op() is calling unlock_pages() potentially with pages being NULL leading to a NULL dereference.  Additionally lock_pages() doesn't check for pin_user_pages_fast() having been completely successful resulting in potentially not locking all pages into memory. This could result in sporadic failures when using the related memory in user mode.  Fix all of that by calling unlock_pages() always with the real number of pinned pages which will be zero in case pages being NULL and by checking the number of pages pinned by pin_user_pages_fast() matching the expected number of pages.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-49697,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix request_sock leak in sk lookup helpers  A customer reported a request_socket leak in a Calico cloud environment. We found that a BPF program was doing a socket lookup with takes a refcnt on the socket and that it was finding the request_socket but returning the parent LISTEN socket via sk_to_full_sk() without decrementing the child request socket 1st resulting in request_sock slab object leak. This patch retains the existing behaviour of returning full socks to the caller but it also decrements the child request_socket if one is present before doing so to prevent the leak.  Thanks to Curtis Taylor for all the help in diagnosing and testing this. And thanks to Antoine Tenart for the reproducer and patch input.  v2 of this patch contains refactor as per Daniel Borkmann's suggestions to validate RCU flags on the listen socket so that it balances with bpf_sk_release() and update comments as per Martin KaFai Lau's suggestion.

CVE-2024-25618,Mastodon is a free open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured authentication providers (CAS SAML OIDC) to attach to existing local users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave. However some well-known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover OpenID Connect also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6 4.1.14 4.0.14 and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,4.2,CWE-287

CVE-2023-29383,In Shadow 4.13 it is possible to inject control characters into fields provided to the SUID program chfn (change finger). Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g. adding a new user fails because \n is in the block list) it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that cat /etc/passwd shows a rogue user account.,3.3,CWE-74
