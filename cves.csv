CVE-2024-39462,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: bcm: dvp: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws  Commit f316cdff8d67 (clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by) annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data' with __counted_by which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in clk_dvp_probe() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has been accessed:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2711-dvp.c:59:2   index 0 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)' (aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')  Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws which clears up the warning.,9.8,CWE-400

CVE-2023-38505,DietPi-Dashboard is a web dashboard for the operating system DietPi. The dashboard only allows for one TLS handshake to be in process at a given moment. Once a TCP connection is established in HTTPS mode it will assume that it should be waiting for a handshake and will stay this way indefinitely until a handshake starts or some error occurs. In version 0.6.1 this can be exploited by simply not starting the handshake preventing any other TLS handshakes from getting through. An attacker can lock the dashboard in a state where it is waiting for a TLS handshake from the attacker who won't provide it. This prevents any legitimate traffic from getting to the dashboard and can last indefinitely. Version 0.6.2 has a patch for this issue. As a workaround do not use HTTPS mode on the open internet where anyone can connect. Instead put a reverse proxy in front of the dashboard and have it handle any HTTPS connections.,7.5,CWE-410

CVE-2023-0466,The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.  As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function.  Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.  Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.,5.3,CWE-295

CVE-2022-31113,Canarytokens is an open source tool which helps track activity and actions on your network. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens. This permits an attacker who recognised an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the Canarytoken's creator. This vulnerability could be used to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken or view its activation history. It might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing more information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For example an attacker could recover the email address tied to the Canarytoken or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the creator's network location. An attacker could only act on the discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens or other Canarytoken creators. The issue has been patched on Canarytokens.org and in the latest release. No signs of successful exploitation of this vulnerability have been found. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,6.3,CWE-79

CVE-2023-53274,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: mediatek: mt8183: Add back SSPM related clocks  This reverts commit 860690a93ef23b567f781c1b631623e27190f101.  On the MT8183 the SSPM related clocks were removed claiming a lack of usage. This however causes some issues when the driver was converted to the new simple-probe mechanism. This mechanism allocates enough space for all the clocks defined in the clock driver not the highest index in the DT binding. This leads to out-of-bound writes if their are holes in the DT binding or the driver (due to deprecated or unimplemented clocks). These errors can go unnoticed and cause memory corruption leading to crashes in unrelated areas or nothing at all. KASAN will detect them.  Add the SSPM related clocks back to the MT8183 clock driver to fully implement the DT binding. The SSPM clocks are for the power management co-processor and should never be turned off.

CVE-2023-40013,SVG Loader is a javascript library that fetches SVGs using XMLHttpRequests and injects the SVG code in the tag's place. According to the docs svg-loader will strip all JS code before injecting the SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not sufficient and can be trivially bypassed.

CVE-2025-59958,An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause impact to confidentiality and availability.  When an output firewall filter is configured with one or more terms where the action is 'reject' packets matching these terms are erroneously sent to the Routing Engine (RE) and further processed there. Processing of these packets will consume limited RE resources. Also responses from the RE back to the source of this traffic could reveal confidential information about the affected device. This issue only applies to firewall filters applied to WAN or revenue interfaces so not the mgmt or lo0 interface of the routing-engine nor any input filters.  This issue affects Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series:      *  all versions before 22.4R3-EVO   *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-EVO.,6.5,CWE-754
CVE-2026-21868,Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. Versions 2.3.2 and below have a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the user profile API endpoint (/api/user/[username]). The application constructs a regular expression dynamically using unescaped user input (the username parameter). An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted username containing regex meta-characters (e.g. deeply nested groups or quantifiers) causing the MongoDB regex engine to consume excessive CPU resources. This can lead to Denial of Service for other users. The issue is fixed in version 2.3.3. To workaround this issue implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to block requests containing regex meta-characters in the URL path.,7.5,CWE-1333

CVE-2022-49664,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tipc: move bc link creation back to tipc_node_create  Shuang Li reported a NULL pointer dereference crash:    [] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference address: 0000000000000068   [] RIP: 0010:tipc_link_is_up+0x5/0x10 [tipc]   [] Call Trace:   []  <IRQ>   []  tipc_bcast_rcv+0xa2/0x190 [tipc]   []  tipc_node_bc_rcv+0x8b/0x200 [tipc]   []  tipc_rcv+0x3af/0x5b0 [tipc]   []  tipc_udp_recv+0xc7/0x1e0 [tipc]  It was caused by the 'l' passed into tipc_bcast_rcv() is NULL. When it creates a node in tipc_node_check_dest() after inserting the new node into hashtable in tipc_node_create() it creates the bc link. However there is a gap between this insert and bc link creation a bc packet may come in and get the node from the hashtable then try to dereference its bc link which is NULL.  This patch is to fix it by moving the bc link creation before inserting into the hashtable.  Note that for a preliminary node becoming real the bc link creation should also be called before it's rehashed as we don't create it for preliminary nodes.,5.5,CWE-476
