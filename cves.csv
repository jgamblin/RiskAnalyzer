CVE-2024-52598,2FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate their security codes. Two interconnected vulnerabilities exist in version 5.4.1 a SSRF and URI validation bypass issue. The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally the library does some basic validation on the URI attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application as long as their content type is text based. If not the request is still sent but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.,7.5,CWE-79

CVE-2022-1922,DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using zlib decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in gst_matroska_decompress_data function which causes a segfault or could cause a heap overwrite depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used and the underlying OS capabilities it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks and the OS supports mmap then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc then this could result in a heap overwrite.,7.8,CWE-122

CVE-2023-28431,Frontier is an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate. Frontier's `modexp` precompile uses `num-bigint` crate under the hood. In the implementation prior to pull request 1017 the cases for modulus being even and modulus being odd are treated separately.

This gas cost discrepancy was not accounted for in the `modexp` precompile leading to possible denial of service attacks.  No fixes for `num-bigint` are currently available and thus this issue is fixed in the short term by raising the gas costs for even modulus and in the long term fixing it in `num-bigint` or switching to another modexp implementation. The short-term fix for Frontier is deployed at pull request 1017. There are no known workarounds aside from applying the fix.,7.5,CWE-682

CVE-2024-2698,A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the forwardable flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.    In FreeIPA 4.11.0 the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset.

CVE-2024-13176,Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.  Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak the attacker process must either be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low.  The FIPS modules in 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.,4.1,CWE-385
