CVE-2024-41042,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate  nft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will result in a call stack overflow (ctx->level >= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).  It also follows maps via ->validate callback in nft_lookup so there appears no reason to iterate the maps again.  nf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed. This improves ruleset load time significantly from 23s down to 12s.  This also fixes a crash bug. Old loop detection code can result in unbounded recursion:  BUG: TASK stack guard page was hit at .... Oops: stack guard page: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN CPU: 4 PID: 1539 Comm: nft Not tainted 6.10.0-rc5+ #1 [..]  with a suitable ruleset during validation of register stores.  I can't see any actual reason to attempt to check for this from nft_validate_register_store() at this point the transaction is still in progress so we don't have a full picture of the rule graph.  For nf-next it might make sense to either remove it or make this depend on table->validate_state in case we could catch an error earlier (for improved error reporting to userspace).,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2025-4598,A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump allowing the attacker to read sensitive data such as /etc/shadow content loaded by the original process.  A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary affecting data confidentiality.,4.7,CWE-364

CVE-2025-53640,Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. Starting in version 2.2 and prior to version 3.3.7 an endpoint used to display details of users listed in certain fields (such as ACLs) could be misused to dump basic user details (such as name affiliation and email) in bulk. Version 3.3.7 fixes the issue. Owners of instances that allow everyone to create a user account who wish to truly restrict access to these user details should consider restricting user search to managers. As a workaround it is possible to restrict access to the affected endpoints (e.g. in the webserver config) but doing so would break certain form fields which could no longer show the details of the users listed in those fields so upgrading instead is highly recommended.,6.5,CWE-200

CVE-2024-26898,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts  This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:    A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux   kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on   `struct net_device` and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing   between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`   global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or   potential code execution.  In aoecmd_cfg_pkts() it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into use-after-free because the net_device is freed.  This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in aoecmd_cfg_pkts() and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-35929,cosign is a container signing and verification utility. In versions prior to 1.10.1 cosign can report a false positive if any attestation exists. `cosign verify-attestation` used with the `--type` flag will report a false positive verification when there is at least one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of the type being verified (--type defaults to custom). This can happen when signing with a standard keypair and with keyless signing with Fulcio. This vulnerability can be reproduced with the `distroless.dev/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2` image. This image has a `vuln` attestation but not an `spdx` attestation. However if you run `cosign verify-attestation --type=spdx` on this image it incorrectly succeeds. This issue has been addressed in version 1.10.1 of cosign. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,7.1,CWE-347

CVE-2024-38606,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FW  The function adf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL) feature on a QAT device by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message to the firmware. This triggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMA buffer in memory and returns an array containing the number of accelerators of each type (slices) supported by this HW. The pointer to this array is stored in the adf_tl_hw_data data structure called slice_cnt.  The array slice_cnt is then used in the function tl_print_dev_data() to report in debugfs only statistics about the supported accelerators. An incorrect value of the elements in slice_cnt might lead to an out of bounds memory read. At the moment there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrong value but for robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW.,7.1,CWE-125
