CVE-2024-47070,authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue.,9.0,CWE-287

These include the insertion of IP and TCP checksums insertion of an Ethernet VLAN header and TCP segmentation offload (TSO).  The e1000 device model uses an on-stack buffer to generate the modified packet header when simulating these modifications on transmitted packets.  When checksum offload is requested for a transmitted packet the e1000 device model used a guest-provided value to specify the checksum offset in the on-stack buffer.  The offset was not validated for certain packet types.  A misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve process on the host possibly leading to code execution in the host context.  The bhyve process runs in a Capsicum sandbox which (depending on the FreeBSD version and bhyve configuration) limits the impact of exploiting this issue.,8.8,CWE-787

CVE-2024-45306,Vim is an open source command line text editor. Patch v9.1.0038 optimized how the cursor position is calculated and removed a loop that verified that the cursor position always points inside a line and does not become invalid by pointing beyond the end of a line. Back then we assumed this loop is unnecessary. However this change made it possible that the cursor position stays invalid and points beyond the end of a line which would eventually cause a heap-buffer-overflow when trying to access the line pointer at the specified cursor position. It's not quite clear yet what can lead to this situation that the cursor points to an invalid position. That's why patch v9.1.0707 does not include a test case. The only observed impact has been a program crash. This issue has been addressed in with the patch v9.1.0707. All users are advised to upgrade.,4.5,CWE-122

CVE-2025-21607,Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. When the Vyper Compiler uses the precompiles EcRecover (0x1) and Identity (0x4) the success flag of the call is not checked. As a consequence an attacker can provide a specific amount of gas to make these calls fail but let the overall execution continue. Then the execution result can be incorrect. Based on EVM's rules after the failed precompile the remaining code has only 1/64 of the pre-call-gas left (as 63/64 were forwarded and spent). Hence only fairly simple executions can follow the failed precompile calls. Therefore we found no significantly impacted real-world contracts. None the less an advisory has been made out of an abundance of caution. This issue is fixed in 0.4.1.,7.5,CWE-670

CVE-2024-28254,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `‎AlertUtil::validateExpression` method evaluates an SpEL expression using `getValue` which by default uses the `StandardEvaluationContext` allowing the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as `java.lang.Runtime` leading to Remote Code Execution. The `/api/v1/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/<expression>` endpoint passes user-controlled data `AlertUtil::validateExpession` allowing authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlaying operating system. In addition there is a missing authorization check since `Authorizer.authorize()` is never called in the affected path and therefore any authenticated non-admin user is able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary SpEL expressions leading to arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-235`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.8,CWE-78

CVE-2024-32028,OpenTelemetry dotnet is a dotnet telemetry framework. In affected versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` the `url.full` writes attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming http requests. These attributes are defined by the Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans. Up until version `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information credentials etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents. Note: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability. The `1.8.1` versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will now redact by default all values detected on transmitted or received query strings.

CVE-2024-26812,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler  A vulnerability exists where the eventfd for INTx signaling can be deconfigured which unregisters the IRQ handler but still allows eventfds to be signaled with a NULL context through the SET_IRQS ioctl or through unmask irqfd if the device interrupt is pending.  Ideally this could be solved with some additional locking; the igate mutex serializes the ioctl and config space accesses and the interrupt handler is unregistered relative to the trigger but the irqfd path runs asynchronous to those.  The igate mutex cannot be acquired from the atomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfd relative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible with existing userspace.  As a result the solution implemented here moves configuration of the INTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context object and irq_type configuration rather than registration of a particular trigger eventfd.  Synchronization is added between the ioctl path and eventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can be dynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks.,5.5,CWE-476
