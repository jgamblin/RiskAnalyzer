CVE-2025-59139,Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. In versions prior to 4.9.7 a flaw in the `bodyLimit` middleware could allow bypassing the configured request body size limit when conflicting HTTP headers were present. The middleware previously prioritized the `Content-Length` header even when a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header was also included. According to the HTTP specification `Content-Length` must be ignored in such cases. This discrepancy could allow oversized request bodies to bypass the configured limit. Most standards-compliant runtimes and reverse proxies may reject such malformed requests with `400 Bad Request` so the practical impact depends on the runtime and deployment environment. If body size limits are used as a safeguard against large or malicious requests this flaw could allow attackers to send oversized request bodies. The primary risk is denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory or CPU consumption when handling very large requests. The implementation has been updated to align with the HTTP specification ensuring that `Transfer-Encoding` takes precedence over `Content-Length`. The issue is fixed in Hono v4.9.7 and all users should upgrade immediately.,5.3,CWE-400

CVE-2025-21767,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clocksource: Use migrate_disable() to avoid calling get_random_u32() in atomic context  The following bug report happened with a PREEMPT_RT kernel:    BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48   in_atomic(): 1 irqs_disabled(): 0 non_block: 0 pid: 2012 name: kwatchdog   preempt_count: 1 expected: 0   RCU nest depth: 0 expected: 0   get_random_u32+0x4f/0x110   clocksource_verify_choose_cpus+0xab/0x1a0   clocksource_verify_percpu.part.0+0x6b/0x330   clocksource_watchdog_kthread+0x193/0x1a0  It is due to the fact that clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() is invoked with preemption disabled.  This function invokes get_random_u32() to obtain random numbers for choosing CPUs.  The batched_entropy_32 local lock and/or the base_crng.lock spinlock in driver/char/random.c will be acquired during the call. In PREEMPT_RT kernel they are both sleeping locks and so cannot be acquired in atomic context.  Fix this problem by using migrate_disable() to allow smp_processor_id() to be reliably used without introducing atomic context. preempt_disable() is then called after clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() but before the clocksource measurement is being run to avoid introducing unexpected latency.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-22009,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: dummy: force synchronous probing  Sometimes I get a NULL pointer dereference at boot time in kobject_get() with the following call stack:  anatop_regulator_probe()  devm_regulator_register()   regulator_register()    regulator_resolve_supply()     kobject_get()  By placing some extra BUG_ON() statements I could verify that this is raised because probing of the 'dummy' regulator driver is not completed ('dummy_regulator_rdev' is still NULL).  In the JTAG debugger I can see that dummy_regulator_probe() and anatop_regulator_probe() can be run by different kernel threads (kworker/u4:*).  I haven't further investigated whether this can be changed or if there are other possibilities to force synchronization between these two probe routines.  On the other hand I don't expect much boot time penalty by probing the 'dummy' regulator synchronously.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-25641,Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version 1.2.27 an arbitrary file write vulnerability exploitable through the Package Import feature allows authenticated users having the Import Templates permission to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server. The vulnerability is located within the `import_package()` function defined into the `/lib/import.php` script. The function blindly trusts the filename and file content provided within the XML data and writes such files into the Cacti base path (or even outside since path traversal sequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the web server leading to execution of arbitrary PHP code or other security impacts. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for this issue.,9.1,CWE-20

CVE-2024-50349,Git is a fast scalable distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When Git asks for credentials via a terminal prompt (i.e. without using any credential helper) it prints out the host name for which the user is expected to provide a username and/or a password. At this stage any URL-encoded parts have been decoded already and are printed verbatim. This allows attackers to craft URLs that contain ANSI escape sequences that the terminal interpret to confuse users e.g. into providing passwords for trusted Git hosting sites when in fact they are then sent to untrusted sites that are under the attacker's control. This issue has been patch via commits `7725b81` and `c903985` which are included in release versions v2.48.1 v2.47.2 v2.46.3 v2.45.3 v2.44.3 v2.43.6 v2.42.4 v2.41.3 and v2.40.4.

CVE-2024-30037,Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability,5.5,CWE-125
CVE-2023-50260,Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention detection and response. A wrong validation in the `host_deny` script allows to write any string in the `hosts.deny` file which can end in an arbitrary command execution on the target system. This vulnerability is part of the active response feature which can automatically triggers actions in response to alerts. By default active responses are limited to a set of pre defined executables. This is enforced by only allowing executables stored under `/var/ossec/active-response/bin` to be run as an active response. However the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/host_deny` can be exploited. `host_deny` is used to add IP address to the `/etc/hosts.deny` file to block incoming connections on a service level by using TCP wrappers. Attacker can inject arbitrary command into the `/etc/hosts.deny` file and execute arbitrary command by using the spawn directive. The active response can be triggered by writing events either to the local `execd` queue on server or to the `ar` queue which forwards the events to agents. So it can leads to LPE on server as root and RCE on agent as root. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.2.,8.8,CWE-94

CVE-2025-58754,Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. When Axios starting in version 0.28.0 and prior to versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme it does not perform HTTP. Instead its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses) so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS) even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`. Versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 contain a patch for the issue.,7.5,CWE-770
CVE-2025-23208,zot is a production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry. The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so group revocations/removals are ignored in the API. SetUserGroups is alled on login but instead of replacing the group memberships they are appended.

After that mlx4_en_alloc_resources() is called and there is a dereference of &tmp->tx_cq[t][i] in mlx4_en_alloc_resources() which could lead to a use after free problem on failure of mlx4_en_copy_priv().  Fix this bug by adding a check of mlx4_en_copy_priv()  This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations (e.g. checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or the callers so they constitute bugs.  Note that as a bug found by static analysis it can be a false positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed the bug.  Builds with CONFIG_MLX4_EN=m show no new warnings and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.,7.8,CWE-416
CVE-2022-48991,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/khugepaged: invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse paths  Any codepath that zaps page table entries must invoke MMU notifiers to ensure that secondary MMUs (like KVM) don't keep accessing pages which aren't mapped anymore.  Secondary MMUs don't hold their own references to pages that are mirrored over so failing to notify them can lead to page use-after-free.  I'm marking this as addressing an issue introduced in commit f3f0e1d2150b (khugepaged: add support of collapse for tmpfs/shmem pages) but most of the security impact of this only came in commit 27e1f8273113 (khugepaged: enable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP) which actually omitted flushes for the removal of present PTEs not just for the removal of empty page tables.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-39199,immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. immudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish between different server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep the state for multiple servers. SDK does not validate this uuid and can accept any value reported by the server. A malicious server can change the reported UUID tricking the client to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state completely irrelevant to the one previously retrieved from the server. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1. As a workaround when initializing an immudb client object a custom state handler can be used to store the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores the server UUID can be used to ensure that even if the server changes the UUID client will still consider it to be the same server.,5.8,CWE-345

CVE-2025-46557,XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.3-rc-1 to before 15.10.14 from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.6 and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.10.0-rc-1 a user who can access pages located in the XWiki space (by default anyone) can access the page XWiki.Authentication.Administration and (unless an authenticator is set in xwiki.cfg) switch to another installed authenticator. Note that by default there is only one authenticator available (Standard XWiki Authenticator). So if no authenticator extension was installed it's not really possible to do anything for an attacker. Also in most cases if an SSO authenticator is installed and utilized (like OIDC or LDAP for example) the worst an attacker can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce).

CVE-2022-49419,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  video: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup  Commit b3c9a924aab6 (fbdev: vesafb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather than .remove) fixed a use-after-free error due the vesafb driver freeing the fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.  This can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove callback since the former tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.  But that change didn't take into account that another possible scenario is that .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback. For example if no process has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.  If that's the case fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is called making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that to no longer be valid.  To prevent that move the expression containing the info->par to happen before the unregister_framebuffer() function call.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-49755,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget: f_fs: Prevent race during ffs_ep0_queue_wait  While performing fast composition switch there is a possibility that the process of ffs_ep0_write/ffs_ep0_read get into a race condition due to ep0req being freed up from functionfs_unbind.  Consider the scenario that the ffs_ep0_write calls the ffs_ep0_queue_wait by taking a lock &ffs->ev.waitq.lock.

CVE-2023-37281,Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet-of-things devices. In versions 4.9 and prior when processing the various IPv6 header fields during IPHC header decompression Contiki-NG confirms the received packet buffer contains enough data as needed for that field. But no similar check is done before decompressing the IPv6 address. Therefore up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds on the line with the statement `memcpy(&ipaddr->u8[16 - postcount] iphc_ptr postcount);`. The value of `postcount` depends on the address compression used in the received packet and can be controlled by the attacker. As a result an attacker can inject a packet that causes an out-of-bound read. As of time of publication a patched version is not available. As a workaround one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2509 to patch the system.,5.3,CWE-125

CVE-2023-26048,Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and very large content. This happens even with the default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51 10.0.14 and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set to a non-negative value so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).,5.3,CWE-400

CVE-2025-59334,Linkr is a lightweight file delivery system that downloads files from a webserver. Linkr versions through 2.0.0 do not verify the integrity or authenticity of .linkr manifest files before using their contents allowing a tampered manifest to inject arbitrary file entries into a package distribution. An attacker can modify a generated .linkr manifest (for example by adding a new entry with a malicious URL) and when a user runs the extract command the client downloads the attacker-supplied file without verification. This enables arbitrary file injection and creates a potential path to remote code execution if a downloaded malicious binary or script is later executed. Version 2.0.1 adds a manifest integrity check that compares the checksum of the original author-created manifest to the one being extracted and aborts on mismatch warning if no original manifest is hosted. Users should update to 2.0.1 or later. As a workaround prior to updating use only trusted .linkr manifests manually verify manifest integrity and host manifests on trusted servers.,9.6,CWE-347
