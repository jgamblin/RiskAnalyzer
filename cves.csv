CVE-2023-22410,A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series platforms with MPC10/MPC11 line cards allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

CVE-2024-23639,Micronaut Framework is a modern JVM-based full stack Java framework designed for building modular easily testable JVM applications with support for Java Kotlin and the Groovy language. Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however some requests are simple and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints if enabled and not secured are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade.,5.1,CWE-15

CVE-2025-29923,go-redis is the official Redis client library for the Go programming language. Prior to 9.5.5 9.6.3 and 9.7.3 go-redis potentially responds out of order when `CLIENT SETINFO` times out during connection establishment. This can happen when the client is configured to transmit its identity there are network connectivity issues or the client was configured with aggressive timeouts. The problem occurs for multiple use cases. For sticky connections you receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the connection. All commands in the pipeline receive incorrect responses. When used with the default ConnPool once a connection is returned after use with ConnPool#Put the read buffer will be checked and the connection will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means that at most one out-of-order response before the connection is discarded. This issue is fixed in 9.5.5 9.6.3 and 9.7.3. You can prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag DisableIndentity to true when constructing the client instance.,3.7,CWE-20
