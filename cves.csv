CVE-2022-24735,Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same or different script at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0 these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable if Lua scripting is not being used is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.,3.9,CWE-94

CVE-2025-32439,pleezer is a headless Deezer Connect player. Hook scripts in pleezer can be triggered by various events like track changes and playback state changes. In versions before 0.16.0 these scripts were spawned without proper process cleanup leaving zombie processes in the system's process table. Even during normal usage every track change and playback event would leave behind zombie processes. This leads to inevitable resource exhaustion over time as the system's process table fills up eventually preventing new processes from being created. The issue is exacerbated if events occur rapidly whether through normal use (e.g. skipping through a playlist) or potential manipulation of the Deezer Connect protocol traffic. This issue has been fixed in version 0.16.0.,6.5,CWE-460

CVE-2025-21744,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()  On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL pointer dereference occurs.  The following sequence deletes the interface:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_remove_interface()       brcmf_del_if()  Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.  After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is called providing the following sequence:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_proto_detach()       brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()         brcmf_flowring_detach()           brcmf_msgbuf_delete_flowring()             brcmf_msgbuf_remove_flowring()               brcmf_flowring_delete()                 brcmf_get_ifp()                 brcmf_txfinalize()  Since brcmf_get_ip() can and actually will return NULL in this case the call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.  This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.  Although the NULL pointer dereference has only been seen when trying to update the tx statistic all other uses of the ifp pointer have been guarded as well with an early return if ifp is NULL.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-42324,Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine but in 32-bit builds it truncates off the most significant bit and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown.

CVE-2022-36062,Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions prior to 8.5.13 9.0.9 and 9.1.6 Grafana is subject to Improper Preservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation on some folders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability impacts Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards as the migrations which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBAC permissions do not account for the scenario where the only user permission in the folder is Admin as a result RBAC adds permissions for Editors and Viewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issue has been patched in versions 8.5.13 9.0.9 and 9.1.6. A workaround when the impacted folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additional permissions manually.,7.6,CWE-281
CVE-2024-4254,The 'deploy-website.yml' workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository specifically in the 'main' branch is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to improper authorization. The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN HF_TOKEN VERCEL_ORG_ID VERCEL_PROJECT_ID COMMENT_TOKEN AWSACCESSKEYID AWSSECRETKEY and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.,7.1,CWE-285

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.,7.5,CWE-89
CVE-2023-52991,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix NULL pointer in skb_segment_list  Commit 3a1296a38d0c (net: Support GRO/GSO fraglist chaining.) introduced UDP listifyed GRO. The segmentation relies on frag_list being untouched when passing through the network stack. This assumption can be broken sometimes where frag_list itself gets pulled into linear area leaving frag_list being NULL. When this happens it can trigger following NULL pointer dereference and panic the kernel. Reverse the test condition should fix it.
