CVE-2023-52564,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert tty: n_gsm: fix UAF in gsm_cleanup_mux  This reverts commit 9b9c8195f3f0d74a826077fc1c01b9ee74907239.  The commit above is reverted as it did not solve the original issue.  gsm_cleanup_mux() tries to free up the virtual ttys by calling gsm_dlci_release() for each available DLCI. There dlci_put() is called to decrease the reference counter for the DLCI via tty_port_put() which finally calls gsm_dlci_free(). This already clears the pointer which is being checked in gsm_cleanup_mux() before calling gsm_dlci_release(). Therefore it is not necessary to clear this pointer in gsm_cleanup_mux() as done in the reverted commit. The commit introduces a null pointer dereference:  <TASK>  ? __die+0x1f/0x70  ? page_fault_oops+0x156/0x420  ? search_exception_tables+0x37/0x50  ? fixup_exception+0x21/0x310  ? exc_page_fault+0x69/0x150  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30  ? tty_port_put+0x19/0xa0  gsmtty_cleanup+0x29/0x80 [n_gsm]  release_one_tty+0x37/0xe0  process_one_work+0x1e6/0x3e0  worker_thread+0x4c/0x3d0  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10  kthread+0xe1/0x110  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10  ret_from_fork+0x2f/0x50  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30  </TASK>  The actual issue is that nothing guards dlci_put() from being called multiple times while the tty driver was triggered but did not yet finished calling gsm_dlci_free().,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-34211,Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049 and Application prior to version 20.0.2786 (VA and SaaS deployments) contain a private SSL key and matching public certificate stored in cleartext. The key belongs to the hostname `pl‑local.com` and is used by the appliance to terminate TLS connections on ports 80/443. Because the key is hardcoded any attacker who can gain container-level access can simply read the files and obtain the private key. With the private key the attacker can decrypt TLS traffic perform man-in-the-middle attacks or forge TLS certificates. This enables impersonation of the appliance’s web UI interception of credentials and unrestricted access to any services that trust the certificate. The same key is identical across all deployed appliances meaning a single theft compromises the confidentiality of every Vasion Print installation. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-025 — Hardcoded SSL Certificate & Private Keys.,4.9,CWE-321

The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.,9.8,CWE-347

CVE-2024-26998,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: core: Clearing the circular buffer before NULLifying it  The circular buffer is NULLified in uart_tty_port_shutdown() under the spin lock. However the PM or other timer based callbacks may still trigger after this event without knowning that buffer pointer is not valid. Since the serial code is a bit inconsistent in checking the buffer state (some rely on the head-tail positions some on the buffer pointer) it's better to have both aligned i.e. buffer pointer to be NULL and head-tail possitions to be the same meaning it's empty. This will prevent asynchronous calls to dereference NULL pointer as reported recently in 8250 case:    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference address: 00000cf5   Workqueue: pm pm_runtime_work   EIP: serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)   ...   ? serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)   __start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1551)   serial8250_start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1654)   serial_port_runtime_suspend (include/linux/serial_core.h:667 drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:63)   __rpm_callback (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:393)   ? serial_port_remove (drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:50)   rpm_suspend (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:447)  The proposed change will prevent ->start_tx() to be called during suspend on shut down port.,5.5,CWE-476
