CVE-2023-47640,DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. The HMAC signature for DataHub Frontend sessions was being signed using a SHA-1 HMAC with the frontend secret key. SHA1 with a 10 byte key can be brute forced using sufficient resources (i.e. state level actors with large computational capabilities). DataHub Frontend was utilizing the Play LegacyCookiesModule with default settings which utilizes a SHA1 HMAC for signing. This is compounded by using a shorter key length than recommended by default for the signing key for the randomized secret value. An authenticated attacker (or attacker who has otherwise obtained a session token) could crack the signing key for DataHub and obtain escalated privileges by generating a privileged session cookie. Due to key length being a part of the risk deployments should update to the latest helm chart and rotate their session signing secret. All deployments using the default helm chart configurations for generating the Play secret key used for signing are affected by this vulnerability. Version 0.11.1 resolves this vulnerability. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.4,CWE-327

CVE-2022-26477,The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable which if tampered with may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix we added an upper bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We classify it as a low-priority but useful improvement. SystemDS is a distributed system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in many code paths (e.g. on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence files) the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints. In this particular case though the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number of columns which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in a consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly improved with almost zero overhead. These code changes are available in versions higher than 2.2.1.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2023-20198,Cisco is providing an update for the ongoing investigation into observed exploitation of the web UI feature in Cisco IOS XE Software. We are updating the list of fixed releases and adding the Software Checker. Our investigation has determined that the actors exploited two previously unknown issues. The attacker first exploited CVE-2023-20198 to gain initial access and issued a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password combination. This allowed the user to log in with normal user access. The attacker then exploited another component of the web UI feature leveraging the new local user to elevate privilege to root and write the implant to the file system. Cisco has assigned CVE-2023-20273 to this issue. CVE-2023-20198 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 10.0. CVE-2023-20273 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 7.2.

CVE-2022-31169,Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift for AArch64 targets where constant divisors can result in incorrect division results at runtime. This affects Wasmtime prior to version 0.38.2 and Cranelift prior to 0.85.2. This issue only affects the AArch64 platform. Other platforms are not affected. The translation rules for constants did not take into account whether sign or zero-extension should happen which resulted in an incorrect value being placed into a register when a division was encountered. The impact of this bug is that programs executing within the WebAssembly sandbox would not behave according to the WebAssembly specification. This means that it is hypothetically possible for execution within the sandbox to go awry and WebAssembly programs could produce unexpected results. This should not impact hosts executing WebAssembly but does affect the correctness of guest programs. This bug has been patched in Wasmtime version 0.38.2 and cranelift-codegen 0.85.2. There are no known workarounds.,5.9,CWE-682

CVE-2025-20224,A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a memory leak resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.    This vulnerability is due to improper parsing of IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a continuous stream of crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to partially exhaust system memory causing system instability like being unable to establish new IKEv2 VPN sessions. A manual reboot of the device is required to recover from this condition.,5.8,CWE-401
CVE-2025-7738,A flaw was found in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) where the Gateway API returns the client secret for certain GitHub Enterprise authenticators in clear text.

CVE-2024-45040,gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Prior to version 0.11.0 commitments to private witnesses in Groth16 as implemented break the zero-knowledge property. The vulnerability affects only Groth16 proofs with commitments. Notably PLONK proofs are not affected. The vulnerability affects the zero-knowledge property of the proofs - in case the witness (secret or internal) values are small then the attacker may be able to enumerate all possible choices to deduce the actual value. If the possible choices for the variables to be committed is large or there are many values committed then it would be computationally infeasible to enumerate all valid choices. It doesn't affect the completeness/soundness of the proofs. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.11.0. The patch to fix the issue is to add additional randomized value to the list of committed value at proving time to mask the rest of the values which were committed. As a workaround the user can manually commit to a randomized value.,5.9,CWE-200

CVE-2024-13176,Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.  Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak the attacker process must either be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low.  The FIPS modules in 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.,4.1,CWE-385

CVE-2025-0685,A flaw was found in grub2. When reading data from a jfs filesystem grub's jfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size however it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the grub_jfs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the internal buffer length during grub_jfs_read_file().

CVE-2021-47218,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails  When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init() h->size is left initialized with a non-zero value but the h->htable pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference since the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed hashtab_init() hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called on it. Yet these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.  Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid empty hashtab when the allocation fails.,5.5,CWE-476

The first referred to as the `CreationRole` is used by lambda handlers to create the cluster and deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest` `HelmChart` ...) onto it. Users with CDK version higher or equal to 1.62.0 (including v2 users) may be affected.
