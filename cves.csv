CVE-2024-26933,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: core: Fix deadlock in port disable sysfs attribute  The show and store callback routines for the disable sysfs attribute file in port.c acquire the device lock for the port's parent hub device.  This can cause problems if another process has locked the hub to remove it or change its configuration:  	Removing the hub or changing its configuration requires the 	hub interface to be removed which requires the port device 	to be removed and device_del() waits until all outstanding 	sysfs attribute callbacks for the ports have returned.  The 	lock can't be released until then.  	But the disable_show() or disable_store() routine can't return 	until after it has acquired the lock.  The resulting deadlock can be avoided by calling sysfs_break_active_protection().  This will cause the sysfs core not to wait for the attribute's callback routine to return allowing the removal to proceed.  The disadvantage is that after making this call there is no guarantee that the hub structure won't be deallocated at any moment.  To prevent this we have to acquire a reference to it first by calling hub_get().,7.8,CWE-667

CVE-2024-41088,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: mcp251xfd: fix infinite loop when xmit fails  When the mcp251xfd_start_xmit() function fails the driver stops processing messages and the interrupt routine does not return running indefinitely even after killing the running application.  Error messages: [  441.298819] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: ERROR in mcp251xfd_start_xmit: -16 [  441.306498] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: Transmit Event FIFO buffer not empty. (seq=0x000017c7 tef_tail=0x000017cf tef_head=0x000017d0 tx_head=0x000017d3). ... and repeat forever.  The issue can be triggered when multiple devices share the same SPI interface. And there is concurrent access to the bus.  The problem occurs because tx_ring->head increments even if mcp251xfd_start_xmit() fails. Consequently the driver skips one TX package while still expecting a response in mcp251xfd_handle_tefif_one().  Resolve the issue by starting a workqueue to write the tx obj synchronously if err = -EBUSY. In case of another error decrement tx_ring->head remove skb from the echo stack and drop the message.

CVE-2025-46343,n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.90.0 n8n is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) through the attachments view endpoint. n8n workflows can store and serve binary files which are accessible to authenticated users. However there is no restriction on the MIME type of uploaded files and the MIME type could be controlled via a GET parameter. This allows the server to respond with any MIME type potentially enabling malicious content to be interpreted and executed by the browser. An authenticated attacker with member-level permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type set to text/html the script executes in the context of the user‚Äôs session. This script could send a request to change the user‚Äôs email address in their account settings effectively enabling account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 1.90.0.,5.0,CWE-79

CVE-2022-31066,EdgeX Foundry is an open source project for building a common open framework for Internet of Things edge computing. Prior to version 2.1.1 the /api/v2/config endpoint exposes message bus credentials to local unauthenticated users. In security-enabled mode message bus credentials are supposed to be kept in the EdgeX secret store and require authentication to access. This vulnerability bypasses the access controls on message bus credentials when running in security-enabled mode. (No credentials are required when running in security-disabled mode.) As a result attackers could intercept data or inject fake data into the EdgeX message bus. Users should upgrade to EdgeXFoundry Kamakura release (2.2.0) or to the June 2022 EdgeXFoundry LTS Jakarta release (2.1.1) to receive a patch. More information about which go modules docker containers and snaps contain patches is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. There are currently no known workarounds for this issue.,5.9,CWE-200
CVE-2023-25809,runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In affected versions it was found that rootless runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when runc is executed inside the user namespace and the `config.json` does not specify the cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.. `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host` with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc is executed outside the user namespace and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind ro` (e.g. `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare). A container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other users's cgroup hierarchies are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts. or add `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`. ,5.0,CWE-281

CVE-2024-35235,OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.8 and earlier when starting the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic link the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the provided argument providing world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as root this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in cups-files.conf and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be achieved which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution. Commit ff1f8a623e090dee8a8aadf12a6a4b25efac143d contains a patch for the issue.,4.4,CWE-59

CVE-2022-0028,A PAN-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware) VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target. To be misused by an external attacker the firewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a source zone that has an external facing interface. This configuration is not typical for URL filtering and if set is likely unintended by the administrator. If exploited this issue would not impact the confidentiality integrity or availability of our products. However the resulting denial-of-service (DoS) attack may help obfuscate the identity of the attacker and implicate the firewall as the source of the attack. We have taken prompt action to address this issue in our PAN-OS software. All software updates for this issue are expected to be released no later than the week of August 15 2022. This issue does not impact Panorama M-Series or Panorama virtual appliances. This issue has been resolved for all Cloud NGFW and Prisma Access customers and no additional action is required from them.,8.6,CWE-406
