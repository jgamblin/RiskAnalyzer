CVE-2024-45016,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netem: fix return value if duplicate enqueue fails  There is a bug in netem_enqueue() introduced by commit 5845f706388a (net: netem: fix skb length BUG_ON in __skb_to_sgvec) that can lead to a use-after-free.  This commit made netem_enqueue() always return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS when a packet is duplicated which can cause the parent qdisc's q.qlen to be mistakenly incremented. When this happens qlen_notify() may be skipped on the parent during destruction leaving a dangling pointer for some classful qdiscs like DRR.  There are two ways for the bug happen:  - If the duplicated packet is dropped by rootq->enqueue() and then   the original packet is also dropped. - If rootq->enqueue() sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc   and the original packet is dropped.  In both cases NET_XMIT_SUCCESS is returned even though no packets are enqueued at the netem qdisc.  The fix is to defer the enqueue of the duplicate packet until after the original packet has been guaranteed to return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS.,5.5,CWE-416

CVE-2025-21636,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: sysctl: plpmtud_probe_interval: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only   from the opener's netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases resulting in an 'Oops'   (null-ptr-deref) e.g. when the current task is exiting as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using container_of().

CVE-2023-0040,Versions of Async HTTP Client prior to 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a form of targeted request manipulation called CRLF injection. This vulnerability was the result of insufficient validation of HTTP header field values before sending them to the network.

CVE-2024-45171,An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to improper user input validation it is possible to upload dangerous files for instance PHP code to the C-MOR system. By analyzing the C-MOR web interface it was found out that the upload functionality for backup files allows an authenticated user to upload arbitrary files. The only condition is that the filename contains a .cbkf string. Therefore webshell.cbkf.php is considered a valid file name for the C-MOR web application. Uploaded files are stored within the directory /srv/www/backups on the C-MOR system and can thus be accessed via the URL https://<HOST>/backup/upload_<FILENAME>. Due to broken access control low-privileged authenticated users can also use this file upload functionality.,8.8,CWE-434

CVE-2024-54150,cjwt is a C JSON Web Token (JWT) Implementation. Algorithm confusion occurs when a system improperly verifies the type of signature used allowing attackers to exploit the lack of distinction between signing methods.  If the system doesn't differentiate between an HMAC signed token and an RS/EC/PS signed token during verification it becomes vulnerable to this kind of attack. For instance an attacker could craft a token with the alg field set to HS256 while the server expects an asymmetric algorithm like RS256. The server might mistakenly use the wrong verification method such as using a public key as the HMAC secret leading to unauthorised access. For RSA the key can be computed from a few signatures. For Elliptic Curve (EC) two potential keys can be recovered from one signature. This can be used to bypass the signature mechanism if an application relies on asymmetrically signed tokens. This issue has been addressed in version 2.3.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,9.1,CWE-347

CVE-2024-50145,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()  build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.  __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb allocation fails keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case don't process the packets and don't push them up the network stack - they are skipped.  Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.

CVE-2024-36105,dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications. Prior to versions 1.6.15 1.7.15 and 1.8.1 Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY` equivalent to `0.0.0.0`. On systems with IPv6 '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY` which is equivalent to `::`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15 dbt-core v1.7.15 and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`. ,5.3,CWE-1327

CVE-2025-27108,dom-expressions is a Fine-Grained Runtime for Performant DOM Rendering. In affected versions the use of javascript's `.replace()` opens up to potential Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities with the special replacement patterns beginning with `$`. Particularly when the attributes of `Meta` tag from solid-meta are user-defined attackers can utilise the special replacement patterns either `$'` or `$\`` to achieve XSS. The solid-meta package has this issue since it uses `useAffect` and context providers which injects the used assets in the html header. dom-expressions uses `.replace()` to insert the assets which is vulnerable to the special replacement patterns listed above.  This effectively means that if the attributes of an asset tag contained user-controlled data it would be vulnerable to XSS. For instance there might be meta tags for the open graph protocol in a user profile page but if attackers set the user query to some payload abusing `.replace()` then they could execute arbitrary javascript in the victim's web browser. Moreover it could be stored and cause more problems. This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,7.3,CWE-79

CVE-2024-47540,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size < 4 the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable. Then in the gst_memory_unmap function the program will attempt to unmap the buffer using the uninitialized map variable causing a function pointer hijack as it will jump to mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full or mem->allocator->mem_unmap. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow potentially leading to code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.,9.8,CWE-457

CVE-2024-45806,Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. A security vulnerability in Envoy allows external clients to manipulate Envoy headers potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious actions within the mesh. This issue arises due to Envoy's default configuration of internal trust boundaries which considers all RFC1918 private address ranges as internal. The default behavior for handling internal addresses in Envoy has been changed. Previously RFC1918 IP addresses were automatically considered internal even if the internal_address_config was empty.  The default configuration of Envoy will continue to trust internal addresses while in this release and it will not trust them by default in next release. If you have tooling such as probes on your private network which need to be treated as trusted (e.g. changing arbitrary x-envoy headers) please explicitly include those addresses or CIDR ranges into `internal_address_config`. Successful exploitation could allow attackers to bypass security controls access sensitive data or disrupt services within the mesh like Istio. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2 1.30.6 1.29.9 and 1.28.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-639
