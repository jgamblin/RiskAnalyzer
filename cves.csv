The problem has been patched in version 0.5.3. No known workarounds exist.,7.5,CWE-335
CVE-2024-34698,FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions of FreeScout prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters Parsing) without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key `__proto__` along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself. As a result the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in an unsafe way this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS Open Redirection Cookie Manipulation Link Manipulation HTML Injection etc. Version 1.8.139 contains a patch for the issue.,4.6,CWE-1321

CVE-2025-27610,Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13 3.0.14 and 3.1.12 `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13 3.0.14 and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static` or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.,7.5,CWE-23

CVE-2024-35827,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()  The controllen variable is type size_t (unsigned long).  Casting it to int could lead to an integer underflow.  The check_add_overflow() function considers the type of the destination which is type int.  If we add two positive values and the result cannot fit in an integer then that's counted as an overflow.  However if we cast controllen to an int and it turns negative then negative values *can* fit into an int type so there is no overflow.  Good: 100 + (unsigned long)-4 = 96  <-- overflow  Bad: 100 + (int)-4 = 96 <-- no overflow  I deleted the cast of the sizeof() as well.  That's not a bug but the cast is unnecessary.,5.5,CWE-190
