CVE-2021-47008,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating  Access to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the GHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCB might not be mapped.  The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered. However if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold then the GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT) which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.  The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about any errors. While it is likely that the GHCB will be mapped in this situation add a safe guard in this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2023-26481,authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Due to an insufficient access check a recovery flow link that is created by an admin (or sent via email by an admin) can be used to set the password for any arbitrary user. This attack is only possible if a recovery flow exists which has both an Identification and an Email stage bound to it. If the flow has policies on the identification stage to skip it when the flow is restored (by checking `request.context['is_restored']`) the flow is not affected by this. With this flow in place an administrator must create a recovery Link or send a recovery URL to the attacker who can due to the improper validation of the token create set the password for any account. Regardless for custom recovery flows it is recommended to add a policy that checks if the flow is restored and skips the identification stage.

CVE-2022-31083,Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2 the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter.

CVE-2024-28255,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.,9.8,CWE-287

CVE-2022-48909,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: fix connection leak  There's a potential leak issue under following execution sequence :  smc_release  				smc_connect_work if (sk->sk_state == SMC_INIT) 					send_clc_confirim 	tcp_abort(); 					... 					sk.sk_state = SMC_ACTIVE smc_close_active switch(sk->sk_state) { ... case SMC_ACTIVE: 	smc_close_final() 	// then wait peer closed  Unfortunately tcp_abort() may discard CLC CONFIRM messages that are still in the tcp send buffer in which case our connection token cannot be delivered to the server side which means that we cannot get a passive close message at all. Therefore it is impossible for the to be disconnected at all.  This patch tries a very simple way to avoid this issue once the state has changed to SMC_ACTIVE after tcp_abort() we can actively abort the smc connection considering that the state is SMC_INIT before tcp_abort() abandoning the complete disconnection process should not cause too much problem.  In fact this problem may exist as long as the CLC CONFIRM message is not received by the server. Whether a timer should be added after smc_close_final() needs to be discussed in the future. But even so this patch provides a faster release for connection in above case it should also be valuable.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-47872,Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** on any Gradio server that allows file uploads. Authenticated users can upload files such as HTML JavaScript or SVG files containing malicious scripts. When other users download or view these files the scripts will execute in their browser allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions or steal sensitive information from their sessions. This impacts any Gradio server that allows file uploads particularly those using components that process or display user-uploaded files. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. As a workaround users can restrict the types of files that can be uploaded to the Gradio server by limiting uploads to non-executable file types such as images or text. Additionally developers can implement server-side validation to sanitize uploaded files ensuring that HTML JavaScript and SVG files are properly handled or rejected before being stored or displayed to users.,5.4,CWE-79

When filesystem mounting fails the flow goes to failed_mount3 where an error occurs when ext4_stop_mmpd is called causing a read I/O failure. This triggers the ext4_handle_error function that ultimately re-arms the timer leaving the s_err_report timer active before kfree(sbi) is called.  Fix the issue by canceling the s_err_report timer after calling ext4_stop_mmpd.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-42082,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xdp: Remove WARN() from __xdp_reg_mem_model()  syzkaller reports a warning in __xdp_reg_mem_model().  The warning occurs only if __mem_id_init_hash_table() returns an error. It returns the error in two cases:    1. memory allocation fails;   2. rhashtable_init() fails when some fields of rhashtable_params      struct are not initialized properly.  The second case cannot happen since there is a static const rhashtable_params struct with valid fields. So warning is only triggered when there is a problem with memory allocation.  Thus there is no sense in using WARN() to handle this error and it can be safely removed.

CVE-2023-43794,Nocodb is an open source Airtable alternative. Affected versions of nocodb contain a SQL injection vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker with creator access to query the underlying database. By supplying a specially crafted payload to the given an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to be executed. Since this is a blind SQL injection an attacker may need to use time-based payloads which would include a function to delay execution for a given number of seconds. The response time indicates whether the result of the query execution was true or false. Depending on the result the HTTP response will be returned after a given number of seconds indicating TRUE or immediately indicating FALSE. In that way an attacker can reveal the data present in the database. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.111.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-141`.,6.5,CWE-89
CVE-2024-26883,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix stackmap overflow check on 32-bit arches  The stackmap code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of hash buckets and contains an overflow check by checking if the resulting value is 0. However on 32-bit arches the roundup code itself can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value which is undefined behaviour so it is not guaranteed to truncate neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type which contains the same check copied from the hashtab code.  The commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this but the fix did not account for the UB so the fix only works on CPUs where an overflow does result in a neat truncation to zero which is not guaranteed. Checking the value before rounding does not have this problem.,7.8,CWE-119

CVE-2024-53861,pyjwt is a JSON Web Token implementation in Python. An incorrect string comparison is run for `iss` checking resulting in `acb` being accepted for `_abc_`. This is a bug introduced in version 2.10.0: checking the iss claim changed from `isinstance(issuer list)` to `isinstance(issuer Sequence)`. Since str is a Sequnce but not a list `in` is also used for string comparison. This results in `if abc not in __abcd__:` being checked instead of `if abc != __abc__:`. Signature checks are still present so real world impact is likely limited to denial of service scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 2.10.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,2.2,CWE-697
