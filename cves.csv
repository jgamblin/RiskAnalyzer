CVE-2023-40584,Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. All versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically the said component extracts a user-controlled tar.gz file without validating the size of its inner files. As a result a malicious low-privileged user can send a malicious tar.gz file that exploits this vulnerability to the repo-server thereby harming the system's functionality and availability. Additionally the repo-server is susceptible to another vulnerability due to the fact that it does not check the extracted file permissions before attempting to delete them. Consequently an attacker can craft a malicious tar.gz archive in a way that prevents the deletion of its inner files when the manifest generation process is completed. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.15 2.7.14 and 2.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade. The only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade however users unable to upgrade should configure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and provide access for configuring applications only to a limited number of administrators. These administrators should utilize trusted and verified Helm charts.,6.5,CWE-400

CVE-2025-20154,A vulnerability in the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) server feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. For Cisco IOS XR Software this vulnerability could cause the ipsla_ippm_server&nbsp;process to reload unexpectedly if debugs are enabled.    This vulnerability is due to out-of-bounds array access when processing specially crafted TWAMP control packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TWAMP control packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload resulting in a DoS condition.  Note: For Cisco IOS XR Software only the ipsla_ippm_server process reloads unexpectedly and only when debugs are enabled. The vulnerability details for Cisco IOS XR Software are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security Impact Rating (SIR): Low&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CVSS Base Score: 3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L,8.6,CWE-20

CVE-2024-28253,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. `CompiledRule::validateExpression` is also called from `PolicyRepository.prepare`. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which in turn gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`) it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and therefore after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method an attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/policies` which gets handled by `PolicyResource.createOrUpdate()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-252`.

CVE-2024-21629,Rust EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine interpreter. In `rust-evm` a feature called `record_external_operation` was introduced allowing library users to record custom gas changes. This feature can have some bogus interactions with the call stack. In particular during finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2` in the case that the substack execution happens successfully `rust-evm` will first commit the substate and then call `record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If `record_external_operation` later fails this error is returned to the parent call stack instead of `Succeeded`. Yet the substate commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to commit state changes when the parent caller contract receives zero address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed). This issue only impacts library users with custom `record_external_operation` that returns errors. The issue is patched in release 0.41.1. No known workarounds are available.,5.9,CWE-703

CVE-2025-5257,SummaryThis advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where unpublished page previews could be accessed by unauthenticated users and potentially indexed by search engines. This could lead to the unintended disclosure of draft content or sensitive information.  Unauthorized Access to Unpublished Page Previews: The page preview functionality for unpublished content accessible via predictable URLs (e.g. /page/preview/1 /page/preview/2) lacked proper authorization checks. This allowed any unauthenticated user to view content that was not yet intended for public release and allowed search engines to index these private preview URLs making the content publicly discoverable. MitigationMautic has patched this vulnerability by enforcing proper permission checks on preview pages. Users should upgrade to the patched version of Mautic or later.,6.5,CWE-1284
