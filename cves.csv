CVE-2022-36092,XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform a generic wiki platform.

CVE-2024-23953,Use of Arrays.equals() in LlapSignerImpl in Apache Hive to compare message signatures allows attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. The attacker should be an authorized user of the product to perform this attack. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0 which fixes this issue.  The problem occurs when an application doesn’t use a constant-time algorithm for validating a signature. The method Arrays.equals() returns false right away when it sees that one of the input’s bytes are different. It means that the comparison time depends on the contents of the arrays. This little thing may allow an attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. So it might allow malicious users to submit splits/work with selected signatures to LLAP without running as a privileged user potentially leading to DDoS attack.

CVE-2024-35797,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: cachestat: fix two shmem bugs  When cachestat on shmem races with swapping and invalidation there are two possible bugs:  1) A swapin error can have resulted in a poisoned swap entry in the    shmem inode's xarray. Calling get_shadow_from_swap_cache() on it    will result in an out-of-bounds access to swapper_spaces[].     Validate the entry with non_swap_entry() before going further.  2) When we find a valid swap entry in the shmem's inode the shadow    entry in the swapcache might not exist yet: swap IO is still in    progress and we're before __remove_mapping; swapin invalidation    or swapoff have removed the shadow from swapcache after we saw the    shmem swap entry.     This will send a NULL to workingset_test_recent(). The latter    purely operates on pointer bits so it won't crash - node 0 memcg    ID 0 eviction timestamp 0 etc. are all valid inputs - but it's a    bogus test. In theory that could result in a false recently    evicted count.     Such a false positive wouldn't be the end of the world. But for    code clarity and (future) robustness be explicit about this case.     Bail on get_shadow_from_swap_cache() returning NULL.,5.3,CWE-787

CVE-2022-23525,Helm is a tool for managing Charts pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Versions prior to 3.10.3 are subject to NULL Pointer Dereference in the _repo_package. The _repo_ package contains a handler that processes the index file of a repository. For example the Helm client adds references to chart repositories where charts are managed. The _repo_ package parses the index file of the repository and loads it into structures Go can work with. Some index files can cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation. Applications that use the _repo_ package in the Helm SDK to parse an index file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic with an index file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client. This issue has been patched in 3.10.3. SDK users can validate index files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the _repo_ functions.,5.3,CWE-476

CVE-2022-41894,TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The reference kernel of the `CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE` TensorFlow Lite operator wrongly increments the data_ptr when adding the bias to the result. Instead of `data_ptr += num_channels;` it should be `data_ptr += output_num_channels;` as if the number of input channels is different than the number of output channels the wrong result will be returned and a buffer overflow will occur if num_channels > output_num_channels. An attacker can craft a model with a specific number of input channels. It is then possible to write specific values through the bias of the layer outside the bounds of the buffer. This attack only works if the reference kernel resolver is used in the interpreter. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 72c0bdcb25305b0b36842d746cc61d72658d2941.
