CVE-2017-16327,Multiple exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the PubNub message handler for the cc channel of Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. Specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. In cmd s_init_event at 0x9d01ea88 the value for the `s_event_offset` key is copied using `strcpy` to the buffer at `$sp+0x2b0`.This buffer is 32 bytes large sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.,9.9,CWE-121

CVE-2024-27043,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free  In dvb_register_device *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev which is freed in several error-handling paths. However *pdvbdev is not set to NULL after dvbdev's deallocation causing use-after-frees in many places for example in the following call chain:  budget_register   |-> dvb_dmxdev_init         |-> dvb_register_device   |-> dvb_dmxdev_release         |-> dvb_unregister_device               |-> dvb_remove_device                     |-> dvb_device_put                           |-> kref_put  When calling dvb_unregister_device dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in dvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed in dvb_register_device. Thereafter this pointer is transferred to kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()  On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space the ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs even though the CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the file the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to wake waiters as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.  While debugging this I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is OK to do) and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is not fine and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).   Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1204705,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2025-24981,MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. In affected versions unsafe parsing logic of the URL from markdown can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code due to a bypass to the existing guards around the `javascript:` protocol scheme in the URL. The parsing logic implement in `props.ts` maintains a deny-list approach to filtering potential malicious payload. It does so by matching protocol schemes like `javascript:` and others. These security guards can be bypassed by an adversarial that provides JavaScript URLs with HTML entities encoded via hex string. Users who consume this library and perform markdown parsing from unvalidated sources could result in rendering vulnerable XSS anchor links. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.13.3 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,9.3,CWE-79

CVE-2021-47214,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hugetlb userfaultfd: fix reservation restore on userfaultfd error  Currently in the is_continue case in hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte() if we bail out using goto out_release_unlock; in the cases where idx >= size or !huge_pte_none() the code will detect that new_pagecache_page == false and so call restore_reserve_on_error().  In this case I see restore_reserve_on_error() delete the reservation and the following call to remove_inode_hugepages() will increment h->resv_hugepages causing a 100% reproducible leak.  We should treat the is_continue case similar to adding a page into the pagecache and set new_pagecache_page to true to indicate that there is no reservation to restore on the error path and we need not call restore_reserve_on_error().  Rename new_pagecache_page to page_in_pagecache to make that clear.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-27059,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command  The isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values in the ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values when creating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands.

CVE-2022-23499,HTML sanitizer is written in PHP aiming to provide XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags attributes and values. In versions prior to 1.5.0 or 2.1.1  malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML CDATA sections cannot be filtered and sanitized due to a parsing issue in the upstream package masterminds/html5. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of typo3/html-sanitizer. The upstream package masterminds/html5 provides HTML raw text elements (`script` `style` `noframes` `noembed` and `iframe`) as DOMText nodes which were not processed and sanitized further. None of the mentioned elements were defined in the default builder configuration that's why only custom behaviors using one of those tag names were vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.5.0 and 2.1.1.,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2022-39278,Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides traffic management policy enforcement and telemetry collection. Prior to versions 1.15.2 1.14.5 and 1.13.9 the Istio control plane istiod is vulnerable to a request processing error allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017 but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster limiting the blast radius. However for some deployments especially external istiod topologies this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions 1.15.2 1.14.5 and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no effective workarounds beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2024-50271,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  signal: restore the override_rlimit logic  Prior to commit d64696905554 (Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of ucounts) UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally even if override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.    For example if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV signal sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the signal delivery preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo.  This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and handling the error.  From the user-space perspective applications are unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes as we observed with java applications.  Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively restores the old behavior.,5.5,CWE-770
