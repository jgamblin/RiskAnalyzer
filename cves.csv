CVE-2024-20262,A vulnerability in the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) and SFTP feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated local attacker to create or overwrite files in a system directory which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker would require valid user credentials to perform this attack.    This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of SCP and SFTP CLI input parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing SCP or SFTP CLI commands with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impact the functionality of the device which could lead to a DoS condition. The device may need to be manually rebooted to recover.

CVE-2023-47128,Piccolo is an object-relational mapping and query builder which supports asyncio. Prior to version 1.1.1 the handling of named transaction `savepoints` in all database implementations is vulnerable to SQL Injection via f-strings. While the likelihood of an end developer exposing a `savepoints` `name` parameter to a user is highly unlikely it would not be unheard of. If a malicious user was able to abuse this functionality they would have essentially direct access to the database and the ability to modify data to the level of permissions associated with the database user. A non exhaustive list of actions possible based on database permissions is: Read all data stored in the database including usernames and password hashes; insert arbitrary data into the database including modifying existing records; and gain a shell on the underlying server. Version 1.1.1 fixes this issue.,9.1,CWE-89

CVE-2024-36402,Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository for Matrix. MMR before version 1.3.5 allows by design unauthenticated remote participants to trigger a download and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver to the local media repository. Such content then also becomes available for download from the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that unauthenticated remote adversaries can use this functionality to plant problematic content into the media repository. MMR 1.3.5 introduces a partial mitigation in the form of new endpoints which require authentication for media downloads. The unauthenticated endpoints will be frozen in a future release closing the attack vector. Though extremely limited server operators can use more strict rate limits based on IP address as a partial workaround.,5.3,CWE-287

CVE-2023-20155,A vulnerability in a logging API in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the device to become unresponsive or trigger an unexpected reload. This vulnerability could also allow an attacker with valid user credentials but not Administrator privileges to view a system log file that they would not normally have access to. This vulnerability is due to a lack of rate-limiting of requests that are sent to a specific API that is related to an FMC log. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of HTTP requests to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the FMC CPU spiking to 100 percent utilization or to the device reloading. CPU utilization would return to normal if the attack traffic was stopped before an unexpected reload was triggered.,7.5,CWE-770
CVE-2023-35789,An issue was discovered in the C AMQP client library (aka rabbitmq-c) through 0.13.0 for RabbitMQ. Credentials can only be entered on the command line (e.g. for amqp-publish or amqp-consume) and are thus visible to local attackers by listing a process and its arguments.,5.5,CWE-522

CVE-2024-55945,TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework. A vulnerability has been identified in the backend user interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically this functionality is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally state-changing actions in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not enforce the appropriate HTTP method. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and to be deceived into interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend which can occur under the following conditions: The user opens a malicious link such as one sent via email. The user visits a compromised or manipulated website while the following settings are misconfigured: 1. `security.backend.enforceReferrer` feature is disabled 2. `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to `lax` or `none`. The vulnerability in the affected downstream component “DB Check Module” allows attackers to manipulate data through unauthorized actions. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 11.5.42 ELTS which fixes the problem described. There are no known workarounds for this issue.,4.3,CWE-352

CVE-2024-21896,The permission model protects itself against path traversal attacks by calling path.resolve() on any paths given by the user. If the path is to be treated as a Buffer the implementation uses Buffer.from() to obtain a Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). By monkey-patching Buffer internals namely Buffer.prototype.utf8Write the application can modify the result of path.resolve() which leads to a path traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21.

CVE-2024-39462,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: bcm: dvp: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws  Commit f316cdff8d67 (clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by) annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data' with __counted_by which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero.

CVE-2024-35997,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-up  The flag I2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations. However this is not necessary because I2C core already has its own locking for that.  More importantly this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set in i2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens the interrupt handler (i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doing anything then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in an infinite loop.  Since interrupt handler is an RT task it takes over the CPU and the flag-clearing task never gets scheduled thus we have a lock-up.  Delete this unnecessary flag.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2023-24534,HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory even when parsing small inputs potentially leading to a denial of service. Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than required to hold the parsed headers.

CVE-2024-46683,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fence  The fence lock is part of the queue therefore in the current design anything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to prevent the queue from being freed.  However currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the queue ref but if something is waiting on the fence the waiter is kicked to wake up at some later point where upon waking up it first grabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have already dropped the queue ref then the lock might already be freed as part of the queue leading to uaf.  To prevent this move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't run into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level lock or only release the queue in the fence release callback however that might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.
