CVE-2024-21327,Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability,7.6,CWE-79
CVE-2024-43790,Vim is an open source command line text editor. When performing a search and displaying the search-count message is disabled (:set shm+=S) the search pattern is displayed at the bottom of the screen in a buffer (msgbuf). When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled the search pattern is reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern contains some ASCII NUL characters the buffer allocated will be smaller than the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed buffer the strlen() function is called which only counts until it notices an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is wrong. This causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by the previously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0689.,4.5,CWE-122

CVE-2022-31081,HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are most Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer or a comma separated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42 42 42`). Anything else MUST be rejected.,7.3,CWE-444

CVE-2024-36402,Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository for Matrix. MMR before version 1.3.5 allows by design unauthenticated remote participants to trigger a download and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver to the local media repository. Such content then also becomes available for download from the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that unauthenticated remote adversaries can use this functionality to plant problematic content into the media repository. MMR 1.3.5 introduces a partial mitigation in the form of new endpoints which require authentication for media downloads. The unauthenticated endpoints will be frozen in a future release closing the attack vector. Though extremely limited server operators can use more strict rate limits based on IP address as a partial workaround.,5.3,CWE-287
