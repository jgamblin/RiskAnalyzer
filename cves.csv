CVE-2021-43816,containerd is an open source container runtime. On installations using SELinux such as EL8 (CentOS RHEL) Fedora or SUSE MicroOS with containerd since v1.5.0-beta.0 as the backing container runtime interface (CRI) an unprivileged pod scheduled to the node may bind mount via hostPath volume any privileged regular file on disk for complete read/write access (sans delete). Such is achieved by placing the in-container location of the hostPath volume mount at either `/etc/hosts` `/etc/hostname` or `/etc/resolv.conf`. These locations are being relabeled indiscriminately to match the container process-label which effectively elevates permissions for savvy containers that would not normally be able to access privileged host files. This issue has been resolved in version 1.5.9. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.,8.0,CWE-281

Nextcloud Server prior to 29.0.15 30.0.9 and 31.0.3 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to 26.0.13.15 27.1.11.15 28.0.14.6 29.0.15 30.0.9 and 31.0.3 have a bug with session handling. The bug caused skipping the second factor confirmation after a successful login with the username and password when the server was configured with `remember_login_cookie_lifetime` set to `0` once the session expired on the page to select the second factor and the page is reloaded. Nextcloud Server 29.0.15 30.0.9 and 31.0.3 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 26.0.13.15 27.1.11.15 28.0.14.6 29.0.15 30.0.9 and 31.0.3 contain a patch. As a workaround set the `remember_login_cookie_lifetime` in config.php to a value other than `0` e.g. `900`. Beware that this is only a workaround for new sessions created after the configuration change. System administration can delete affected sessions.,6.4,CWE-287

CVE-2024-26718,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm-crypt dm-verity: disable tasklets  Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock then it calls the tasklet callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may free it tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.  The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt but it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1]. There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory with every tasklet-processed bio.  There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory corruption problem.  But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be backported to the stable kernels. So I'm proposing this commit that disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't remove the tasklet support because the tasklet code will be reused when atomic workqueues will be implemented.

CVE-2025-46820,phpgt/Dom provides access to modern DOM APIs. Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact.

CVE-2021-47548,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ethernet: hisilicon: hns: hns_dsaf_misc: fix a possible array overflow in hns_dsaf_ge_srst_by_port()  The if statement:   if (port >= DSAF_GE_NUM)         return;  limits the value of port less than DSAF_GE_NUM (i.e. 8). However if the value of port is 6 or 7 an array overflow could occur:   port_rst_off = dsaf_dev->mac_cb[port]->port_rst_off;  because the length of dsaf_dev->mac_cb is DSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM (i.e. 6).  To fix this possible array overflow we first check port and if it is greater than or equal to DSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM the function returns.,9.8,CWE-129

CVE-2021-47172,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non sequential channel numbers  Channel numbering must start at 0 and then not have any holes or it is possible to overflow the available storage.  Note this bug was introduced as part of a fix to ensure we didn't rely on the ordering of child nodes.  So we need to support arbitrary ordering but they all need to be there somewhere.  Note I hit this when using qemu to test the rest of this series. Arguably this isn't the best fix but it is probably the most minimal option for backporting etc.  Alexandru's sign-off is here because he carried this patch in a larger set that Jonathan then applied.,5.5,CWE-120
CVE-2023-33192,ntpd-rs is an NTP implementation written in Rust. ntpd-rs does not validate the length of NTS cookies in received NTP packets to the server.

The server also crashes when it is not configured to handle NTS packets. The issue was caused by improper slice indexing. The indexing operations were replaced by safer alternatives that do not crash the ntpd-rs server process but instead properly handle the error condition. A patch was released in version 0.3.3.,7.5,CWE-130

CVE-2022-31098,Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations aka KubeConfg of registered Kubernetes clusters including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.
