CVE-2024-36932,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal  Since thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock it can run in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may free the struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been checked against NULL.  If that happens thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory that has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.  Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around the cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

CVE-2025-49138,HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior to version 11.0.0 an authenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the HAXCMS saveOutline endpoint allows a low-privileged user to read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the location field written into site.json. This enables attackers to exfiltrate sensitive system files such as /etc/passwd application secrets or configuration files accessible to the web server (www-data). The vulnerability stems from the way the HAXCMS backend handles the location field in the site's outline. When a user sends a POST request to /system/api/saveOutline the backend stores the provided location value directly into the site.json file associated with the site without validating or sanitizing the input. Later the location parameter is interpreted by the CMS to resolve and load the content for a given node. If the location field contains a relative path like `../../../etc/passwd` the application will attempt to read and render that file. Version 11.0.0 fixes the issue.,6.5,CWE-22

CVE-2023-49783,Silverstripe Admin provides a basic management interface for the Silverstripe Framework. In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19 and on the 2.x branch prior to 2.1.8 users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form provided they have create permissions.

Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch for the issue. Those who have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should update their implementations to respect permissions when the return value of `getCheckPermissions()` is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in their own project logic or maintain a module which uses it should consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()` if the data is provided by users.,4.3,CWE-863

CVE-2022-20943,Multiple vulnerabilities in the Server Message Block Version 2 (SMB2) processor of the Snort detection engine on multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass the configured policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.    These vulnerabilities are due to improper management of system resources when the Snort detection engine is processing SMB2 traffic.

CVE-2023-23611,LTI Consumer XBlock implements the consumer side of the LTI specification enabling integration of third-party LTI provider tools. Versions 7.0.0 and above prior to 7.2.2 are vulnerable to Missing Authorization.  Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX platform can post a grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows or can guess the block location for that XBlock. An LTI tool submits scores to the edX platform for line items. The code that uploads that score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to upload the grades for by reading the resource_link_id field of the associated line item. The LTI tool may submit any value for the resource_link_id field allowing a malicious LTI tool to submit scores for any LTI XBlock on the platform. The impact is a loss of integrity for LTI XBlock grades. This issue is patched in 7.2.2. No workarounds exist.,5.4,CWE-862

CVE-2025-53888,RIOT-OS an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices has an ineffective size check implemented with `assert()` can lead to buffer overflow in versions up to and including 2025.04. Assertions are usually compiled out in production builds. If assertions are the only defense against untrusted inputs the software may be exposed to attacks that utilize the lack of proper input checks. In the `l2filter_add()` function shown below `addr_len` is checked using an assertion and is subsequently used as an argument in a `memcpy()` call. When assertions are disabled there would be no size check for `addr_len`. As a consequence if an attacker were to provide an `addr_len` value larger than `CONFIG_L2FILTER_ADDR_MAXLEN` they can trigger a buffer overflow and write past the `list[i].addr` buffer. If the unchecked input is attacker-controlled the impact of the buffer overflow can range from a denial of service to arbitrary code execution. Commit f6f7de4ccc107c018630e4c15500825caf02e1c2 contains a patch for the vulnerability.,9.8,CWE-120

CVE-2024-58034,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  memory: tegra20-emc: fix an OF node reference bug in tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code()  As of_find_node_by_name() release the reference of the argument device node tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code() releases some device nodes while still in use resulting in possible UAFs. According to the bindings and the in-tree DTS files the emc-tables node is always device's child node with the property nvidiause-ram-code and the lpddr2 node is a child of the emc-tables node. Thus utilize the for_each_child_of_node() macro and of_get_child_by_name() instead of of_find_node_by_name() to simplify the code.
