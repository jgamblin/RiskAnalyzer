CVE-2023-43637, Due to the implementation of deriveVaultKey prior to version 7.10 the generated vault key would always have the last 16 bytes predetermined to be arfoobarfoobarfo.  This issue happens because deriveVaultKey calls retrieveCloudKey (which will always return foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo as the key) and then merges the 32byte randomly generated key with this key (by takeing 16bytes from each see mergeKeys).  This makes the key a lot weaker.  This issue does not persist in devices that were initialized on/after version 7.10 but devices that were initialized before that and updated to a newer version still have this issue.    Roll an update that enforces the full 32bytes key usage.       ,7.8,CWE-321

CVE-2022-23583,Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that any binary op would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the op. In that case calling the templated binary operator for the binary op would receive corrupted data due to the type confusion involved. If `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly. In most cases this would be a silent failure but we have noticed scenarios where this results in a `CHECK` crash hence a denial of service. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1 TensorFlow 2.6.3 and TensorFlow 2.5.3 as these are also affected and still in supported range.,6.5,CWE-617

CVE-2024-42231,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zoned: fix calc_available_free_space() for zoned mode  calc_available_free_space() returns the total size of metadata (or system) block groups which can be allocated from unallocated disk space. The logic is wrong on zoned mode in two places.  First the calculation of data_chunk_size is wrong. We always allocate one zone as one chunk and no partial allocation of a zone. So we should use zone_size (= data_sinfo->chunk_size) as it is.  Second the result avail may not be zone aligned. Since we always allocate one zone as one chunk on zoned mode returning non-zone size aligned bytes will result in less pressure on the async metadata reclaim process.  This is serious for the nearly full state with a large zone size device. Allowing over-commit too much will result in less async reclaim work and end up in ENOSPC. We can align down to the zone size to avoid that.,5.5,CWE-682

CVE-2025-49128,Jackson-core contains core low-level incremental (streaming) parser and generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.13.0 a flaw in jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible information disclosure in systems using pooled or reused buffers like Netty or Vert.x. This issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0 released on September 30 2021 via PR #652. All users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later. If upgrading is not immediately possible applications can mitigate the issue by disabling exception message exposure to clients to avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses and/or disabling source inclusion in exceptions to prevent Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages avoiding leakage.,4.0,CWE-209

CVE-2023-52617,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove  A PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The call to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit at a point way past switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the trailing put_device() just before return.  At that later point in time the devm cleanup has already removed the stdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also the stdev->pdev reference was not a counted one. Therefore in DMA mode the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause a fatal page fault and the subsequent dma_free_coherent() if reached would pass a stale &stdev->pdev->dev pointer.  Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove() after stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref is now optional but may prevent future accidents.

CVE-2024-56512,Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 2.0.0 are missing fine-grained authorization checking for Parameter Contexts referenced Controller Services and referenced Parameter Providers when creating new Process Groups.  Creating a new Process Group can include binding to a Parameter Context but in cases where the Process Group did not reference any Parameter values the framework did not check user authorization for the bound Parameter Context. Missing authorization for a bound Parameter Context enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process Group.  Creating a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did not check user authorization for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers enabling clients to create Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized.  This vulnerability is limited in scope to authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with component-based authorization policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation which includes authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process Group creation.,5.4,CWE-638

CVE-2022-24731,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.5.0 but before versions 2.1.11 2.2.6 and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability allowing a malicious user with read/write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `create` or `update` access to Applications can leak the contents of any text file on the repo-server. By crafting a malicious Helm chart and using it in an Application the attacker can retrieve the sensitive file's contents either as part of the generated manifests or in an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from another Application's source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11 2.2.6 and 2.3.0. The problem can be mitigated by avoiding storing secrets in git avoiding mounting secrets as files on the repo-server avoiding decrypting secrets into files on the repo-server and carefully limiting who can `create` or `update` Applications.,6.8,CWE-22

CVE-2024-27309,While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.  Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug: 1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL 2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.  When those two preconditions are met Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal rather than the two or more that would be correct.  The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).  The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.,7.4,CWE-863

CVE-2023-30861,Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.  1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies. 2. The application sets `session.permanent = True` 3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request. 4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default). 5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.  This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.,7.5,CWE-539

CVE-2024-35846,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory  Christian reports a NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap shrinker.  The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1] and the Red Hat bugzilla [2].  The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag the zswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL.  This is okay in many places like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in memcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of cgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.  Nhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case and I was then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.
