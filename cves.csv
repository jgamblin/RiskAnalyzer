CVE-2025-34199,Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.1049 and Application versions prior to 20.0.2786 (VA and SaaS deployments) contain insecure defaults and code patterns that disable TLS/SSL certificate verification for communications to printers and internal microservices. In multiple places the application sets libcurl/PHP transport options such that CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER are effectively disabled and environment variables (for example API_*_VERIFYSSL=false) are used to turn off verification for gateway and microservice endpoints. As a result the client accepts TLS connections without validating server certificates (and in some cases uses clear-text HTTP) permitting on-path attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. An attacker able to intercept network traffic between the product and printers or microservices can eavesdrop on and modify sensitive data (including print jobs configuration and authentication tokens) inject malicious payloads or disrupt service. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-024 — Insecure Communication to Printers & Microservices.,8.1,CWE-295

CVE-2025-64714,PrivateBin is an online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data. Starting in version 1.7.7 and prior to version 2.0.3 an unauthenticated Local File Inclusion exists in the template-switching feature. If `templateselection` is enabled in the configuration the server trusts the `template` cookie and includes the referenced PHP file. An attacker can read sensitive data or if they manage to drop a PHP file elsewhere gain remote code execution. The constructed path of the template file is checked for existence then included. For PrivateBin project files this does not leak any secrets due to data files being created with PHP code that prevents execution but if a configuration file without that line got created or the visitor figures out the relative path to a PHP script that directly performs an action without appropriate privilege checking those might execute or leak information. The issue has been patched in version 2.0.3. As a workaround set `templateselection = false` (which is the default) in `cfg/conf.php` or remove it entirely,5.8,CWE-23

CVE-2023-47640,DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. The HMAC signature for DataHub Frontend sessions was being signed using a SHA-1 HMAC with the frontend secret key. SHA1 with a 10 byte key can be brute forced using sufficient resources (i.e. state level actors with large computational capabilities). DataHub Frontend was utilizing the Play LegacyCookiesModule with default settings which utilizes a SHA1 HMAC for signing. This is compounded by using a shorter key length than recommended by default for the signing key for the randomized secret value. An authenticated attacker (or attacker who has otherwise obtained a session token) could crack the signing key for DataHub and obtain escalated privileges by generating a privileged session cookie. Due to key length being a part of the risk deployments should update to the latest helm chart and rotate their session signing secret. All deployments using the default helm chart configurations for generating the Play secret key used for signing are affected by this vulnerability. Version 0.11.1 resolves this vulnerability. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.4,CWE-327

CVE-2023-22490,Git is a revision control system. Using a specially-crafted repository Git prior to versions 2.39.2 2.38.4 2.37.6 2.36.5 2.35.7 2.34.7 2.33.7 2.32.6 2.31.7 and 2.30.8 can be tricked into using its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport. Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.  A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6 v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is impractical two short-term workarounds are available. Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`. Instead consider cloning repositories without recursively cloning their submodules and instead run `git submodule update` at each layer. Before doing so inspect each new `.gitmodules` file to ensure that it does not contain suspicious module URLs.,5.5,CWE-59

CVE-2024-34359,llama-cpp-python is the Python bindings for llama.cpp. `llama-cpp-python` depends on class `Llama` in `llama.py` to load `.gguf` llama.cpp or Latency Machine Learning Models. The `__init__` constructor built in the `Llama` takes several parameters to configure the loading and running of the model. Other than `NUMA LoRa settings` `loading tokenizers` and `hardware settings` `__init__` also loads the `chat template` from targeted `.gguf` 's Metadata and furtherly parses it to `llama_chat_format.Jinja2ChatFormatter.to_chat_handler()` to construct the `self.chat_handler` for this model. Nevertheless `Jinja2ChatFormatter` parse the `chat template` within the Metadate with sandbox-less `jinja2.Environment` which is furthermore rendered in `__call__` to construct the `prompt` of interaction. This allows `jinja2` Server Side Template Injection which leads to remote code execution by a carefully constructed payload.,9.6,CWE-76

CVE-2022-50288,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  qlcnic: prevent ->dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure  adapter->dcb would get silently freed inside qlcnic_dcb_enable() in case qlcnic_dcb_attach() would return an error which always happens under OOM conditions. This would lead to use-after-free because both of the existing callers invoke qlcnic_dcb_get_info() on the obtained pointer which is potentially freed at that point.  Propagate errors from qlcnic_dcb_enable() and instead free the dcb pointer at callsite using qlcnic_dcb_free(). This also removes the now unused qlcnic_clear_dcb_ops() helper which was a simple wrapper around kfree() also causing memory leaks for partially initialized dcb.

CVE-2024-49985,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: stm32f7: Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume  In case there is any sort of clock controller attached to this I2C bus controller for example Versaclock or even an AIC32x4 I2C codec then an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare callback may trigger a deadlock on drivers/clk/clk.c prepare_lock mutex.  This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex and then performs the prepare operation including its I2C access. The I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback which calls clk_prepare_enable() which attempts to grab the prepare_lock mutex again and deadlocks.  Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in remove() use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume to avoid hitting the prepare_lock mutex.,5.5,CWE-667
