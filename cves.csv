CVE-2021-47482,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: batman-adv: fix error handling  Syzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was in wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().  Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well when there is some kind of indicator which can tell which parts of batadv are initialized; but there isn't any.  All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide ODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work syzbot was able to hit GPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths() because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]  To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one. It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling path 2) It improves the performance since we won't call unneeded batadv_*_free() functions.  So this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory before returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free() and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching uninitialized fields.,5.3,CWE-544

CVE-2024-29192,gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. The `/api/config` endpoint allows one to modify the existing configuration with user-supplied values. While the API is only allowing localhost to interact without authentication an attacker may be able to achieve that depending on how go2rtc is set up on the upstream application and given that this endpoint is not protected against CSRF it allows requests from any origin (e.g. a drive-by attack) . The `exec` handler allows for any stream to execute arbitrary commands. An attacker may add a custom stream through `api/config` which may lead to arbitrary command execution. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question their browser will execute the requests against the go2rtc instance.

CVE-2023-50711,vmm-sys-util is a collection of modules that provides helpers and utilities used by multiple rust-vmm components. Starting in version 0.5.0 and prior to version 0.12.0 an issue in the `FamStructWrapper::deserialize` implementation provided by the crate for `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does not check that the length stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods. The issue was corrected in version 0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal for any deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover the API was changed so that header length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds memory access from Rust-safe code.,5.7,CWE-787

CVE-2023-52081,ffcss is a CLI interface to apply and configure Firefox CSS themes. Prior to 0.2.0 the function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. The `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (﹍) which would result in the omitted U+005F (_) for instance. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively while ignoring dashes underscores and dots) so the actual security impact is classified as low. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.2.0. There are no known workarounds.,5.3,CWE-74
