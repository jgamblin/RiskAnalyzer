CVE-2024-9050,A flaw was found in the libreswan client plugin for NetworkManager (NetkworkManager-libreswan) where it fails to properly sanitize the VPN configuration from the local unprivileged user. In this configuration composed by a key-value format the plugin fails to escape special characters leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine by creating a malicious configuration.,7.8,CWE-94

CVE-2023-2512,Prior to version v1.20230419.0 the FormData API implementation was subject to an integer overflow. If a FormData instance contained more than 2^31 elements the forEach() method could end up reading from the wrong location in memory while iterating over elements. This would most likely lead to a segmentation fault but could theoretically allow arbitrary undefined behavior.   In order for the bug to be exploitable the process would need to be able to allocate 160GB of RAM. Due to this the bug was never exploitable on the Cloudflare Workers platform but could theoretically be exploitable on deployments of workerd running on machines with a huge amount of memory. Moreover in order to be remotely exploited an attacker would have to upload a single form-encoded HTTP request of at least tens of gigabytes in size. The application code would then have to use request.formData() to parse the request and formData.forEach() to iterate over this data. Due to these limitations the exploitation likelihood was considered Low.  A fix that addresses this vulnerability has been released in version v1.20230419.0 and users are encouraged to update to the latest version available.   ,6.5,CWE-125

CVE-2024-5967,A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL  independently without re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. This flaw allows an attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) to change the LDAP host URL (Connection URL) to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain.,2.7,CWE-276
CVE-2025-3008,A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Novastar CX40 up to 2.44.0.

The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.,5.5,CWE-74
CVE-2024-27050,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()  When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf bpf_xdp_query_opts the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro. This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally which means that programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by libbpf writing out of bounds.  The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS) macro but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency this fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET() macro.,5.5,CWE-787

CVE-2024-25625,Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. A potential security vulnerability has been discovered in `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4. The vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the `invitationLinkAction` function of the UserController specifically in the way `$loginUrl` trusts user input.  The host header from incoming HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs. An attacker can manipulate the HTTP host header in requests to the /admin/user/invitationlink endpoint resulting in the generation of URLs with the attacker's domain. In fact if a host header is injected in the POST request the $loginURL parameter is constructed with this unvalidated host header. It is then used to send an invitation email to the provided user. This vulnerability can be used to perform phishing attacks by making the URLs in the invitation links emails point to an attacker-controlled domain. Version 1.3.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability. The maintainers recommend validating the host header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It would also be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the incoming host header is not recognized or is absent.,8.1,CWE-74

CVE-2024-2511,Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions  Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service  This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replay protection is in use). In this case under certain conditions the session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

CVE-2023-30543,@web3-react is a framework for building Ethereum Apps . In affected versions the `chainId` may be outdated if the user changes chains as part of the connection flow. This means that the value of `chainId` returned by `useWeb3React()` may be incorrect. In an application this means that any data derived from `chainId` could be incorrect.

CVE-2023-29529,matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call is taking place can eavesdrop on the video and audio of participants using matrix-js-sdk without their knowledge.

CVE-2023-50916,Kyocera Device Manager before 3.1.1213.0 allows NTLM credential exposure during UNC path authentication via a crafted change from a local path to a UNC path. It allows administrators to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \ (backslash) character which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy or sending the request directly to the application endpoint allows UNC paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the environment this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.,7.2,CWE-22
