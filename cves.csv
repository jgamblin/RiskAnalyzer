CVE-2024-44947,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fuse: Initialize beyond-EOF page contents before setting uptodate  fuse_notify_store() unlike fuse_do_readpage() does not enable page zeroing (because it can be used to change partial page contents).  So fuse_notify_store() must be more careful to fully initialize page contents (including parts of the page that are beyond end-of-file) before marking the page uptodate.  The current code can leave beyond-EOF page contents uninitialized which makes these uninitialized page contents visible to userspace via mmap().  This is an information leak but only affects systems which do not enable init-on-alloc (via CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y or the corresponding kernel command line parameter).,5.5,CWE-665

CVE-2024-35247,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fpga: region: add owner module and take its refcount  The current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-level module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region during programming if the parent device does not have a driver.  To address this problem add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for registering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper macros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.  Also update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface for registering an fpga region.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-31994,Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0 an attacker can point the image request to an arbitrarily large file. Mealie will attempt to retrieve this file in whole. If it can be retrieved it may be stored on the file system in whole (leading to possible disk consumption) however the more likely scenario given resource limitations is that the container will OOM during file retrieval if the target file size is greater than the allocated memory of the container. At best this can be used to force the container to infinitely restart due to OOM (if so configured in `docker-compose.yml) or at worst this can be used to force the Mealie container to crash and remain offline. In the event that the file can be retrieved the lack of rate limiting on this endpoint also permits an attacker to generate ongoing requests to any target of their choice potentially contributing to an external-facing DoS attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.,6.5,CWE-400

CVE-2022-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()  On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space the ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs even though the CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the file the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to wake waiters as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.  While debugging this I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is OK to do) and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is not fine and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).

CVE-2025-22618,WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `adicionar_cargo.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `cargo` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `adicionar_cargo.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.2.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.4,CWE-79
