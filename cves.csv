CVE-2024-26999,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial/pmac_zilog: Remove flawed mitigation for rx irq flood  The mitigation was intended to stop the irq completely. That may be better than a hard lock-up but it turns out that you get a crash anyway if you're using pmac_zilog as a serial console:  ttyPZ0: pmz: rx irq flood ! BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0 swapper/0  That's because the pr_err() call in pmz_receive_chars() results in pmz_console_write() attempting to lock a spinlock already locked in pmz_interrupt(). With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y this produces a fatal BUG splat. The spinlock in question is the one in struct uart_port.  Even when it's not fatal the serial port rx function ceases to work. Also the iteration limit doesn't play nicely with QEMU as can be seen in the bug report linked below.  A web search for other reports of the error message pmz: rx irq flood didn't produce anything. So I don't think this code is needed any more. Remove it.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-62505,LobeChat is an open source chat application platform. The web-crawler package in LobeChat version 1.136.1 allows server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the tools.search.crawlPages tRPC endpoint. A client can supply an arbitrary urls array together with impls containing the value naive. The service passes the user URLs to Crawler.crawl and the naive implementation performs a server-side fetch of each supplied URL without validating or restricting internal network addresses (such as localhost 127.0.0.1 private IP ranges or cloud instance metadata endpoints). This allows an attacker with a valid user token (or in development mode using a bypass header) to make the server disclose responses from internal HTTP services potentially exposing internal API data or cloud metadata credentials. Version 1.136.2 fixes the issue. Update to version 1.136.2. No known workarounds exist.,3.0,CWE-918

CVE-2024-26846,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-fc: do not wait in vain when unloading module  The module exit path has race between deleting all controllers and freeing 'left over IDs'. To prevent double free a synchronization between nvme_delete_ctrl and ida_destroy has been added by the initial commit.  There is some logic around trying to prevent from hanging forever in wait_for_completion though it does not handling all cases. E.g. blktests is able to reproduce the situation where the module unload hangs forever.  If we completely rely on the cleanup code executed from the nvme_delete_ctrl path all IDs will be freed eventually. This makes calling ida_destroy unnecessary. We only have to ensure that all nvme_delete_ctrl code has been executed before we leave nvme_fc_exit_module. This is done by flushing the nvme_delete_wq workqueue.  While at it remove the unused nvme_fc_wq workqueue too.,4.4,CWE-415

CVE-2024-28252,CoreWCF is a port of the service side of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to .NET Core. If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service extra system resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service and sends no data the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally once a client has established a session if the client doesn't send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this behavior are NetTcpBinding NetNamedPipeBinding and UnixDomainSocketBinding. Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections. The currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.2 of the CoreWCF packages. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue. ,7.5,CWE-404

CVE-2024-23333,LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP directory. LAM's log configuration allows to specify arbitrary paths for log files. Prior to version 8.7 an attacker could exploit this by creating a PHP file and cause LAM to log some PHP code to this file. When the file is then accessed via web the code would be executed. The issue is mitigated by the following: An attacker needs to know LAM's master configuration password to be able to change the main settings; and the webserver needs write access to a directory that is accessible via web. LAM itself does not provide any such directories. The issue has been fixed in 8.7. As a workaround limit access to LAM configuration pages to authorized users. ,7.9,CWE-74

It first holds the spinlock bond->stats_lock and then call hinic_get_stats64() to collect hinic device's stats. However hinic_get_stats64() calls `down(&nic_dev->mgmt_lock)` to protect its critical section which may schedule current task out. And if system is under high pressure the task cannot be woken up immediately which eventually triggers kernel hung panic.  Since previous patch has replaced hinic_dev.tx_stats/rx_stats with local variable in hinic_get_stats64() there is nothing need to be protected by lock so just removing down()/up() is ok.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-21846,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  acct: perform last write from workqueue  In [1] it was reported that the acct(2) system call can be used to trigger NULL deref in cases where it is set to write to a file that triggers an internal lookup. This can e.g. happen when pointing acc(2) to /sys/power/resume. At the point the where the write to this file happens the calling task has already exited and called exit_fs(). A lookup will thus trigger a NULL-deref when accessing current->fs.  Reorganize the code so that the the final write happens from the workqueue but with the caller's credentials. This preserves the (strange) permission model and has almost no regression risk.  This api should stop to exist though.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-42352,Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. `nuxt/icon` provides an API to allow client side icon lookup. This endpoint is at `/api/_nuxt_icon/[name]`. The proxied request path is improperly parsed allowing an attacker to change the scheme and host of the request. This leads to SSRF and could potentially lead to sensitive data exposure. The `new URL` constructor is used to parse the final path. This constructor can be passed a relative scheme or path in order to change the host the request is sent to. This constructor is also very tolerant of poorly formatted URLs. As a result we can pass a path prefixed with the string `http:`. This has the effect of changing the scheme to HTTP. We can then subsequently pass a new host for example `http:127.0.0.1:8080`. This would allow us to send requests to a local server. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.4.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.6,CWE-918

CVE-2025-27137,Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6 users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka Alert) and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself and highly discouraged.,4.4,CWE-73
