CVE-2022-29246,Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host device and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack. Prior to version 6.1.11 he USBX DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function does not assure that a buffer overflow will not occur during handling of the DFU UPLOAD command. When an attacker issues the `UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD` control transfer request with `wLenght` larger than the buffer size (`UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH` 256 bytes) depending on the actual implementation of `dfu -> ux_slave_class_dfu_read` a buffer overflow may occur. In example `ux_slave_class_dfu_read` may read 4096 bytes (or more up to 65k) to a 256 byte buffer ultimately resulting in an overflow. Furthermore in case an attacker has some control over the read flash memory this may result in execution of arbitrary code and platform compromise. A fix for this issue has been included in USBX release 6.1.11. As a workaround align request and buffer size to assure that buffer boundaries are respected.,9.8,CWE-120

CVE-2024-32462,Flatpak is a system for building distributing and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9 1.12.9 1.14.6 and 1.15.8 a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=` such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap` and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap` which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8 1.10.9 1.12.9 and 1.14.6.,8.4,CWE-88
CVE-2024-4146,In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.2.13 an incorrect authorization vulnerability exists that allows unauthorized users to access and manipulate projects within an organization they should not have access to. Specifically the vulnerability is located in the `checkProjectAccess` method within the authorization middleware which fails to adequately verify if a user has the correct permissions to access a specific project. Instead it only checks if the user is part of the organization owning the project overlooking the necessary check against the `account_project` table for explicit project access rights. This flaw enables attackers to gain complete control over all resources within a project including the ability to create update read and delete any resource compromising the privacy and security of sensitive information.,9.8,CWE-863

CVE-2023-41167,@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer before 5.37.2 allows XSS attacks by content managers. This is a react component to render data coming from Webiny Headless CMS and Webiny Form Builder. Webiny is an open-source serverless enterprise CMS. The @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer package depends on the editor.js rich text editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich text content from the editor.js into the database. When the @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer is used to render such content it uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop without applying HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor who in this context would specifically be a content manager with access to the CMS inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined input. This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser when the main page or admin page loads.,4.8,CWE-79

CVE-2024-53088,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state  Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN filters by setting mac and port VLAN.  1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan(). 2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac(). 3. Subsequently i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters() which         refers to the already freed filter memory causing corruption.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn multiple VFs. 2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change         MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host. 3. Observe errors in dmesg: Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX 	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX.  Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.  The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list. These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but must be removed using the full process.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2024-46695,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  selinuxsmack: don't bypass permissions check in inode_setsecctx hook  Marek Gresko reports that the root user on an NFS client is able to change the security labels on files on an NFS filesystem that is exported with root squashing enabled.  The end of the kerneldoc comment for __vfs_setxattr_noperm() states:   *  This function requires the caller to lock the inode's i_mutex before it  *  is executed. It also assumes that the caller will make the appropriate  *  permission checks.  nfsd_setattr() does do permissions checking via fh_verify() and nfsd_permission() but those don't do all the same permissions checks that are done by security_inode_setxattr() and its related LSM hooks do.  Since nfsd_setattr() is the only consumer of security_inode_setsecctx() simplest solution appears to be to replace the call to __vfs_setxattr_noperm() with a call to __vfs_setxattr_locked().  This fixes the above issue and has the added benefit of causing nfsd to recall conflicting delegations on a file when a client tries to change its security label.,4.4,CWE-276

CVE-2024-32477,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. By using ANSI escape sequences and a race between `libc::tcflush(0 libc::TCIFLUSH)` and reading standard input it's possible to manipulate the permission prompt and force it to allow an unsafe action regardless of the user input. Some ANSI escape sequences act as a info request to the master terminal emulator and the terminal emulator sends back the reply in the PTY channel. standard streams also use this channel to send and get data. For example the `\033[6n` sequence requests the current cursor position. These sequences allow us to append data to the standard input of Deno. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass Deno permission policy.  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.42.2. ,7.7,CWE-78

CVE-2024-38606,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FW  The function adf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL) feature on a QAT device by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message to the firmware. This triggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMA buffer in memory and returns an array containing the number of accelerators of each type (slices) supported by this HW. The pointer to this array is stored in the adf_tl_hw_data data structure called slice_cnt.  The array slice_cnt is then used in the function tl_print_dev_data() to report in debugfs only statistics about the supported accelerators. An incorrect value of the elements in slice_cnt might lead to an out of bounds memory read. At the moment there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrong value but for robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW.,7.1,CWE-125
