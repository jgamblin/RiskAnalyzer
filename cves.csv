CVE-2022-24765,Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git` which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\.git\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile e.g. `C:\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.,6.0,CWE-427

CVE-2024-50005,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker  In the `mac802154_scan_worker` function the `scan_req->type` field was accessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According to RCU usage rules this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable behavior such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.  This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.  To address this the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU rules.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-28096,OpenSIPS a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation has a memory leak starting in the 2.3 branch and priot to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5. The memory leak was detected in the function `parse_mi_request` while performing coverage-guided fuzzing. This issue can be reproduced by sending multiple requests of the form `{jsonrpc: 2.0method: log_le`. This malformed message was tested against an instance of OpenSIPS via FIFO transport layer and was found to increase the memory consumption over time.  To abuse this memory leak attackers need to reach the management interface (MI) which typically should only be exposed on trusted interfaces. In cases where the MI is exposed to the internet without authentication abuse of this issue will lead to memory exhaustion which may affect the underlying system’s availability. No authentication is typically required to reproduce this issue. On the other hand memory leaks may occur in other areas of OpenSIPS where the cJSON library is used for parsing JSON objects.  The issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.,4.5,CWE-401

Therefore when a `session_id` is given kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point it does not correctly verify if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus a session which's lifetime is already `> time()` is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function that does remove invalid sessions is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()` based on `session.gc_divisor` `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1 session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.5,CWE-613

CVE-2023-33187,Highlight is an open source full-stack monitoring platform. Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type=text` via a javascript Show Password button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=password` inputs.

CVE-2024-41088,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: mcp251xfd: fix infinite loop when xmit fails  When the mcp251xfd_start_xmit() function fails the driver stops processing messages and the interrupt routine does not return running indefinitely even after killing the running application.  Error messages: [  441.298819] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: ERROR in mcp251xfd_start_xmit: -16 [  441.306498] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: Transmit Event FIFO buffer not empty. (seq=0x000017c7 tef_tail=0x000017cf tef_head=0x000017d0 tx_head=0x000017d3). ... and repeat forever.  The issue can be triggered when multiple devices share the same SPI interface. And there is concurrent access to the bus.  The problem occurs because tx_ring->head increments even if mcp251xfd_start_xmit() fails. Consequently the driver skips one TX package while still expecting a response in mcp251xfd_handle_tefif_one().  Resolve the issue by starting a workqueue to write the tx obj synchronously if err = -EBUSY. In case of another error decrement tx_ring->head remove skb from the echo stack and drop the message.
