CVE-2022-49326,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtl818x: Prevent using not initialized queues  Using not existing queues can panic the kernel with rtl8180/rtl8185 cards. Ignore the skb priority for those cards they only have one tx queue. Pierre Asselin (pa@panix.com) reported the kernel crash in the Gentoo forum:  https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1147832-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-25.html  He also confirmed that this patch fixes the issue. In summary this happened:  After updating wpa_supplicant from 2.9 to 2.10 the kernel crashed with a divide error: 0000 when connecting to an AP. Control port tx now tries to use IEEE80211_AC_VO for the priority which wpa_supplicants starts to use in 2.10.  Since only the rtl8187se part of the driver supports QoS the priority of the skb is set to IEEE80211_AC_BE (2) by mac80211 for rtl8180/rtl8185 cards.  rtl8180 is then unconditionally reading out the priority and finally crashes on drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl818x/rtl8180/dev.c line 544 without this patch: 	idx = (ring->idx + skb_queue_len(&ring->queue)) % ring->entries  ring->entries is zero for rtl8180/rtl8185 cards tx_ring[2] never got initialized.,5.5,CWE-908

CVE-2023-30541,OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. A function in the implementation contract may be inaccessible if its selector clashes with one of the proxy's own selectors. Specifically if the clashing function has a different signature with incompatible ABI encoding the proxy could revert while attempting to decode the arguments from calldata. The probability of an accidental clash is negligible but one could be caused deliberately and could cause a reduction in availability. The issue has been fixed in version 4.8.3. As a workaround if a function appears to be inaccessible for this reason it may be possible to craft the calldata such that ABI decoding does not fail at the proxy and the function is properly proxied through.,5.3,CWE-436

CVE-2023-36471,Xwiki commons is the common modules used by other XWiki top level projects. The HTML sanitizer that is included in XWiki since version 14.6RC1 allowed form and input HTML tags. In the context of XWiki this allows an attacker without script right to either create forms that can be used for phishing attacks or also in the context of a sheet the attacker could add an input like `{{html}}<input type=hidden name=content value={{groovy}}println(&quot;Hello from Groovy!&quot;) />{{/html}}` that would allow remote code execution when it is submitted by an admin (the sheet is rendered as part of the edit form). The attacker would need to ensure that the edit form looks plausible though which can be non-trivial as without script right the attacker cannot display the regular content of the document. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.2RC1 by removing the central form-related tags from the list of allowed tags. Users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround an admin can manually disallow the tags by adding `form input select textarea button` to the configuration option `xml.htmlElementSanitizer.forbidTags` in the `xwiki.properties` configuration file.,9.0,CWE-74

CVE-2024-35895,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem  syzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes elements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be invoked from any interrupt context locks taken during a map_delete_elem operation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion is possible as reported by lockdep:         CPU0                    CPU1        ----                    ----   lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);                                local_irq_disable();                                lock(&host->lock);                                lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);   <Interrupt>     lock(&host->lock);  Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be deleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts enabled or in softirq context.  Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is _not_ hardirq-unsafe that is interrupts are disabled and bail out with an error.  Note that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does not allow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-42152,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet: fix a possible leak when destroy a ctrl during qp establishment  In nvmet_sq_destroy we capture sq->ctrl early and if it is non-NULL we know that a ctrl was allocated (in the admin connect request handler) and we need to release pending AERs clear ctrl->sqs and sq->ctrl (for nvme-loop primarily) and drop the final reference on the ctrl.  However a small window is possible where nvmet_sq_destroy starts (as a result of the client giving up and disconnecting) concurrently with the nvme admin connect cmd (which may be in an early stage). But *before* kill_and_confirm of sq->ref (i.e. the admin connect managed to get an sq live reference). In this case sq->ctrl was allocated however after it was captured in a local variable in nvmet_sq_destroy. This prevented the final reference drop on the ctrl.  Solve this by re-capturing the sq->ctrl after all inflight request has completed where for sure sq->ctrl reference is final and move forward based on that.  This issue was observed in an environment with many hosts connecting multiple ctrls simoutanuosly creating a delay in allocating a ctrl leading up to this race window.,4.7,CWE-401

Prior to versions 1.26.0 1.25.3 1.24.4 1.23.6 and 1.22.9 the OAuth filter assumes that a `state` query param is present on any response that looks like an OAuth redirect response. Sending it a request with the URI path equivalent to the redirect path without the `state` parameter will lead to abnormal termination of Envoy process. Versions 1.26.0 1.25.3 1.24.4 1.23.6 and 1.22.9 contain a patch. The issue can also be mitigated by locking down OAuth traffic disabling the filter or by filtering traffic before it reaches the OAuth filter (e.g. via a lua script).  ,6.5,CWE-20
CVE-2023-33621,GL.iNET GL-AR750S-Ext firmware v3.215 inserts the admin authentication token into a GET request when the OpenVPN Server config file is downloaded. The token is then left in the browser history or access logs potentially allowing attackers to bypass authentication via session replay.,5.9,CWE-294

CVE-2024-11542,IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24703.,7.8,CWE-119
CVE-2025-26773,Missing Authorization vulnerability in Adnan Analytify allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels. This issue affects Analytify: from n/a through 5.5.0.,4.3,CWE-862
CVE-2023-52486,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm: Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock handling  If we get a deadlock after the fb lookup in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl() we proceed to unref the fb and then retry the whole thing from the top. But we forget to reset the fb pointer back to NULL and so if we then get another error during the retry before the fb lookup we proceed the unref the same fb again without having gotten another reference. The end result is that the fb will (eventually) end up being freed while it's still in use.  Reset fb to NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again until we've done another fb lookup.  This turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2 when doing async flips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The first symptom I saw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop while walking the framebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince it to oops instead and from there it was easier to track down the culprit.,5.5,CWE-667
