CVE-2024-46676,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: pn533: Add poll mod list filling check  In case of im_protocols value is 1 and tm_protocols value is 0 this combination successfully passes the check 'if (!im_protocols && !tm_protocols)' in the nfc_start_poll(). But then after pn533_poll_create_mod_list() call in pn533_start_poll() poll mod list will remain empty and dev->poll_mod_count will remain 0 which lead to division by zero.  Normally no im protocol has value 1 in the mask so this combination is not expected by driver. But these protocol values actually come from userspace via Netlink interface (NFC_CMD_START_POLL operation). So a broken or malicious program may pass a message containing a bad combination of protocol parameter values so that dev->poll_mod_count is not incremented inside pn533_poll_create_mod_list() thus leading to division by zero. Call trace looks like: nfc_genl_start_poll()   nfc_start_poll()     ->start_poll()     pn533_start_poll()  Add poll mod list filling check.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.,5.5,CWE-369

CVE-2024-52811,The ngtcp2 project is an effort to implement IETF QUIC protocol in C. In affected versions acks are not validated before being written to the qlog leading to a buffer overflow. In `ngtcp2_conn::conn_recv_pkt` for an ACK there was new logic that got added to skip `conn_recv_ack` if an ack has already been processed in the payload. However this causes us to also skip `ngtcp2_pkt_validate_ack`. The ack which was skipped still got written to qlog. The bug occurs in `ngtcp2_qlog::write_ack_frame`. It is now possible to reach this code with an invalid ack suppose `largest_ack=0` and `first_ack_range=15`. Subtracting `largest_ack - first_ack_range` will lead to an integer underflow which is 20 chars long. However the ngtcp2 qlog code assumes the number written is a signed integer and only accounts for 19 characters of overhead (see `NGTCP2_QLOG_ACK_FRAME_RANGE_OVERHEAD`). Therefore we overwrite the buffer causing a heap overflow. This is high priority and could potentially impact many users if they enable qlog. qlog is disabled by default. Due to its overhead it is most likely used for debugging purpose but the actual use is unknown. ngtcp2 v1.9.1 fixes the bug and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not turn on qlog.,8.2,CWE-670

CVE-2025-34195,Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735 and Application prior to 20.0.1330 (Windows client deployments) contain a remote code execution vulnerability during driver installation caused by unquoted program paths. The PrinterInstallerClient driver-installation component launches programs using an unquoted path under C:\Program Files (x86)\Printer Properties Pro\Printer Installer. Because the path is unquoted the operating system may execute a program located at a short-path location such as C:\Program.exe before the intended binaries in the quoted path. If an attacker can place or cause a program to exist at that location it will be executed with the privileges of the installer process (which may be elevated) enabling arbitrary code execution and potential privilege escalation. This weakness can be used to achieve remote code execution and full compromise of affected Windows endpoints. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2022-006 — Driver Upload Security.,9.8,CWE-434
