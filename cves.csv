CVE-2023-52497,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression  Currently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplace decompression that was used to handle the cases that some pages of compressed data are actually not in-place I/O.  However like most simple LZ77 algorithms LZ4 expects the compressed data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and it explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:   __________________________________________________________  |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|  Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this it typically maps two individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain. Previously it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem to completely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reported that EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor. After some analysis it seems that recent x86 processors with the new FSRM feature expose this issue with rep movsb.  Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace decompression for now.  Later as an useful improvement we could try to tie up these two buffers together in the correct order.,6.1,CWE-787

CVE-2024-47083,Power Platform Terraform Provider allows managing environments and other resources within Power Platform. Versions prior to 3.0.0 have an issue in the Power Platform Terraform Provider where sensitive information specifically the `client_secret` used in the service principal authentication may be exposed in logs. This exposure occurs due to an error in the logging code that causes the `client_secret` to not be properly masked when logs are persisted or viewed. Users should upgrade to version 3.0.0 to receive a patched version of the provider that removes all logging of sensitive content. Users who have used this provider with the affected versions should take the following additional steps to mitigate the risk: Immediately rotate the `client_secret` for any service principal that has been configured using this Terraform provider. This will invalidate any potentially exposed secrets. Those who have set the `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variable or configured Terraform to persist logs to a file or an external system consider disabling this until they have updated to a fixed version of the provider. Those who have existing logs that may contain the `client_secret` should remove or sanitize these logs to prevent unauthorized access. This includes logs on disk in monitoring systems or in logging services.,7.5,CWE-117

CVE-2024-50001,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Fix error path in multi-packet WQE transmit  Remove the erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was established  The multi-packet WQE transmit code attempts to obtain a DMA mapping for the skb. This could fail e.g. under memory pressure when the IOMMU driver just can't allocate more memory for page tables. While the code tries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneously unmaps one entry from the sq's FIFO list of active mappings. Since the current map attempt failed this unmap is removing some random DMA mapping that might still be required. If the PCI function now presents that IOVA the IOMMU may assumes a rogue DMA access and e.g. on s390 puts the PCI function in error state.  The erroneous behavior was seen in a stress-test environment that created memory pressure.,5.5,CWE-755

CVE-2023-26481,authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Due to an insufficient access check a recovery flow link that is created by an admin (or sent via email by an admin) can be used to set the password for any arbitrary user. This attack is only possible if a recovery flow exists which has both an Identification and an Email stage bound to it. If the flow has policies on the identification stage to skip it when the flow is restored (by checking `request.context['is_restored']`) the flow is not affected by this. With this flow in place an administrator must create a recovery Link or send a recovery URL to the attacker who can due to the improper validation of the token create set the password for any account. Regardless for custom recovery flows it is recommended to add a policy that checks if the flow is restored and skips the identification stage.

CVE-2024-57953,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: tps6594: Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems  The problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset()  	tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;  The tmp variable is an s64 but offset is a long in the (-277774)-277774 range.  On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to approximately two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large (32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million.

CVE-2024-55553,In FRRouting (FRR) before 10.3 from 6.0 onward all routes are re-validated if the total size of an update received via RTR exceeds the internal socket's buffer size default 4K on most OSes. An attacker can use this to trigger re-parsing of the RIB for FRR routers using RTR by causing more than this number of updates during an update interval (usually 30 minutes). Additionally this effect regularly occurs organically. Furthermore an attacker can use this to trigger route validation continuously. Given that routers with large full tables may need more than 30 minutes to fully re-validate the table continuous issuance/withdrawal of large numbers of ROA may be used to impact the route handling performance of all FRR instances using RPKI globally. Additionally the re-validation will cause heightened BMP traffic to ingestors. Fixed Versions: 10.0.3 10.1.2 10.2.1 >= 10.3.,7.5,CWE-404

CVE-2025-27610,Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13 3.0.14 and 3.1.12 `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory.
