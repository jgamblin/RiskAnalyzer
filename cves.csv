CVE-2024-24575,libgit2 is a portable C implementation of the Git core methods provided as a linkable library with a solid API allowing to build Git functionality into your application. Using well-crafted inputs to `git_revparse_single` can cause the function to enter an infinite loop potentially causing a Denial of Service attack in the calling application. The revparse function in `src/libgit2/revparse.c` uses a loop to parse the user-provided spec string.

CVE-2024-26912,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/nouveau: fix several DMA buffer leaks  Nouveau manages GSP-RM DMA buffers with nvkm_gsp_mem objects.  Several of these buffers are never dealloced.  Some of them can be deallocated right after GSP-RM is initialized but the rest need to stay until the driver unloads.  Also futher bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer and clearing the nvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated.  Poisoning the buffer should trigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it tries to access the buffer after we've deallocated it because we were wrong about when it is safe to deallocate.

CVE-2024-48984,An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. When parsing hci reports the hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of a list of reports by reading a byte from an input stream. It then fetches the length of the first report uses it to calculate the beginning of the second report etc. In doing this it tracks the largest report so it can later allocate a buffer that fits every individual report (but only one at a time). It does not however validate that these addresses are all contained within the buffer passed to hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport. It is then possible though unlikely that the buffer designated to hold the reports is allocated in such a way that one of these out-of-bounds length fields is contained within the new buffer. When the (n-1)th report is copied it overwrites the length field of the nth report. This now corrupted length field is then used for a memcpy into the new buffer which may lead to a buffer overflow.,9.8,CWE-120

CVE-2022-42332,x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where host assisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) is unavailable Xen will run guests in so called shadow mode. Shadow mode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page tables as well as auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests Xen additionally runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.,7.8,CWE-416
