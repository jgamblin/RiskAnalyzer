CVE-2025-67499,The CNI portmap plugin allows containers to emulate opening a host port forwarding that traffic to the container. Versions 1.6.0 through 1.8.0  inadvertently forward all traffic with the same destination port as the host port when the portmap plugin is configured with the nftables backend thus ignoring the destination IP. This includes traffic not intended for the node itself i.e. traffic to containers hosted on the node. Containers that request HostPort forwarding can intercept all traffic destined for that port. This requires that the portmap plugin be explicitly configured to use the nftables backend. This issue is fixed in version 1.9.0. To workaround configure the portmap plugin to use the iptables backend. It does not have this vulnerability.,6.6,CWE-200

CVE-2022-50417,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panfrost: Fix GEM handle creation ref-counting  panfrost_gem_create_with_handle() previously returned a BO but with the only reference being from the handle which user space could in theory guess and release causing a use-after-free. Additionally if the call to panfrost_gem_mapping_get() in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo() failed then a(nother) reference on the BO was dropped.  The _create_with_handle() is a problematic pattern so ditch it and instead create the handle in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo(). If the call to panfrost_gem_mapping_get() fails then this means that user space has indeed gone behind our back and freed the handle. In which case just return an error code.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-21682,Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified in the manifest so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done so this is not problem. However if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization which can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use the only issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write permissions. However a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.,7.7,CWE-22

CVE-2022-50287,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/bios: fix a memory leak in generate_lfp_data_ptrs  When (size != 0 || ptrs->lvds_ entries != 3) the program tries to free() the ptrs. However the ptrs is not created by calling kzmalloc() but is obtained by pointer offset operation. This may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior.  Fix this by replacing the arguments of kfree() with ptrs_block.  (cherry picked from commit 7674cd0b7d28b952151c3df26bbfa7e07eb2b4ec),5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-36952,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up  There are cases after NPIV deletion where the fabric switch still believes the NPIV is logged into the fabric.  This occurs when a vport is unregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the fabric.  Currently fc_remove_host() which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDs including the fabric D_ID removes the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rport object.  This sometimes causes the race condition where the final DA_ID and LOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch.  Fix by moving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID and LOGO are sent.,4.7,CWE-459

CVE-2025-21772,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  partitions: mac: fix handling of bogus partition table  Fix several issues in partition probing:   - The bailout for a bad partoffset must use put_dev_sector() since the    preceding read_part_sector() succeeded.  - If the partition table claims a silly sector size like 0xfff bytes    (which results in partition table entries straddling sector boundaries)    bail out instead of accessing out-of-bounds memory.  - We must not assume that the partition table contains proper NUL    termination - use strnlen() and strncmp() instead of strlen() and    strcmp().,7.8,CWE-787
CVE-2021-47593,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets  The mptcp ULP extension relies on sk->sk_sock_kern being set correctly: It prevents setsockopt(fd IPPROTO_TCP TCP_ULP mptcp 6); from working for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).  But in case of fallback accept() can return a plain tcp sk. In such case sk is still tagged as 'kernel' and setsockopt will work.  This will crash the kernel The subflow extension has a NULL ctx->conn mptcp socket:  BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in subflow_data_ready+0x181/0x2b0 Call Trace:  tcp_data_ready+0xf8/0x370  [..],5.5,CWE-476
