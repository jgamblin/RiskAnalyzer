CVE-2023-30429,Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Pulsar.  This issue affects Apache Pulsar: before 2.10.4 and 2.11.0.  When a client connects to the Pulsar Function Worker via the Pulsar Proxy where the Pulsar Proxy uses mTLS authentication to authenticate with the Pulsar Function Worker the Pulsar Function Worker incorrectly performs authorization by using the Proxy's role for authorization instead of the client's role which can lead to privilege escalation especially if the proxy is configured with a superuser role.  The recommended mitigation for impacted users is to upgrade the Pulsar Function Worker to a patched version.  2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.4. 2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1. 3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users are unaffected.

CVE-2025-29769,libvips is a demand-driven horizontally threaded image processing library.  The heifsave operation could incorrectly determine the presence of an alpha channel in an input when it was not possible to determine the colour interpretation known internally within libvips as multiband.

CVE-2024-30252,Livemarks is a browser extension that provides RSS feed bookmark folders. Versions of Livemarks prior to 3.7 are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request. The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML. `subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html` an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`. This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker this integrity is broken. Version 3.7 fixes this issue by removing subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources`. ,2.6,CWE-352

CVE-2024-53143,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsnotify: Fix ordering of iput() and watched_objects decrement  Ensure the superblock is kept alive until we're done with iput(). Holding a reference to an inode is not allowed unless we ensure the superblock stays alive which fsnotify does by keeping the watched_objects count elevated so iput() must happen before the watched_objects decrement. This can lead to a UAF of something like sb->s_fs_info in tmpfs but the UAF is hard to hit because race orderings that oops are more likely thanks to the CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() block in generic_shutdown_super().  Also ensure that fsnotify_put_sb_watched_objects() doesn't call fsnotify_sb_watched_objects() on a superblock that may have already been freed which would cause a UAF read of sb->s_fsnotify_info.,7.8,CWE-416
