CVE-2024-46682,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: prevent panic for nfsv4.0 closed files in nfs4_show_open  Prior to commit 3f29cc82a84c (nfsd: split sc_status out of sc_type) states_show() relied on sc_type field to be of valid type before calling into a subfunction to show content of a particular stateid. From that commit we split the validity of the stateid into sc_status and no longer changed sc_type to 0 while unhashing the stateid. This resulted in kernel oopsing for nfsv4.0 opens that stay around and in nfs4_show_open() would derefence sc_file which was NULL.  Instead for closed open stateids forgo displaying information that relies of having a valid sc_file.  To reproduce: mount the server with 4.0 read and close a file and then on the server cat /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/2/states  [  513.590804] Call trace: [  513.590925]  _raw_spin_lock+0xcc/0x160 [  513.591119]  nfs4_show_open+0x78/0x2c0 [nfsd] [  513.591412]  states_show+0x44c/0x488 [nfsd] [  513.591681]  seq_read_iter+0x5d8/0x760 [  513.591896]  seq_read+0x188/0x208 [  513.592075]  vfs_read+0x148/0x470 [  513.592241]  ksys_read+0xcc/0x178,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-56670,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget: u_serial: Fix the issue that gs_start_io crashed due to accessing null pointer  Considering that in some extreme cases when u_serial driver is accessed by multiple threads Thread A is executing the open operation and calling the gs_open Thread B is executing the disconnect operation and calling the gserial_disconnect functionThe port->port_usb pointer will be set to NULL.  E.g.     Thread A                                 Thread B     gs_open()                                gadget_unbind_driver()     gs_start_io()                            composite_disconnect()     gs_start_rx()                            gserial_disconnect()     ...                                      ...     spin_unlock(&port->port_lock)     status = usb_ep_queue()                  spin_lock(&port->port_lock)     spin_lock(&port->port_lock)              port->port_usb = NULL     gs_free_requests(port->port_usb->in)     spin_unlock(&port->port_lock)     Crash  This causes thread A to access a null pointer (port->port_usb is null) when calling the gs_free_requests function causing a crash.  If port_usb is NULL the release request will be skipped as it will be done by gserial_disconnect.  So add a null pointer check to gs_start_io before attempting to access the value of the pointer port->port_usb.

CVE-2021-47183,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference  If an FC link down transition while PLOGIs are outstanding to fabric well known addresses outstanding ABTS requests may result in a NULL pointer dereference. Driver unload requests may hang with repeated 2878 log messages.  The Link down processing results in ABTS requests for outstanding ELS requests. The Abort WQEs are sent for the ELSs before the driver had set the link state to down. Thus the driver is sending the Abort with the expectation that an ABTS will be sent on the wire. The Abort request is stalled waiting for the link to come up. In some conditions the driver may auto-complete the ELSs thus if the link does come up the Abort completions may reference an invalid structure.  Fix by ensuring that Abort set the flag to avoid link traffic if issued due to conditions where the link failed.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-44932,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: fix UAFs when destroying the queues  The second tagged commit started sometimes (very rarely but possible) throwing WARNs from net/core/page_pool.c:page_pool_disable_direct_recycling(). Turned out idpf frees interrupt vectors with embedded NAPIs *before* freeing the queues making page_pools' NAPI pointers lead to freed memory before these pools are destroyed by libeth. It's not clear whether there are other accesses to the freed vectors when destroying the queues but anyway we usually free queue/interrupt vectors only when the queues are destroyed and the NAPIs are guaranteed to not be referenced anywhere.  Invert the allocation and freeing logic making queue/interrupt vectors be allocated first and freed last. Vectors don't require queues to be present so this is safe. Additionally this change allows to remove that useless queue->q_vector pointer cleanup as vectors are still valid when freeing the queues (+ both are freed within one function so it's not clear why nullify the pointers at all).,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-21545,Proxmox Virtual Environment is an open-source server management platform for enterprise virtualization. Insufficient safeguards against malicious API response values allow authenticated attackers with 'Sys.Audit' or 'VM.Monitor' privileges to download arbitrary host files via the API. When handling the result from a request handler before returning it to the user the handle_api2_request function will check for the ‘download’ or ‘data’->’download’ objects inside the request handler call response object. If present handle_api2_request will read a local file defined by this object and return it to the user. Two endpoints were identified which can control the object returned by a request handler sufficiently that the ’download’ object is defined and user controlled. This results in arbitrary file read. The privileges of this file read can result in full compromise of the system by various impacts such as disclosing sensitive files allowing for privileged session forgery.,8.2,CWE-73

CVE-2024-13176,Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.  Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak the attacker process must either be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low.  The FIPS modules in 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.,4.1,CWE-385
