CVE-2024-39462,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: bcm: dvp: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws  Commit f316cdff8d67 (clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by) annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data' with __counted_by which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in clk_dvp_probe() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has been accessed:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2711-dvp.c:59:2   index 0 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)' (aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')  Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws which clears up the warning.,9.8,CWE-400

CVE-2023-23586,Due to a vulnerability in the io_uring subsystem it is possible to leak kernel memory information to the user process. timens_install calls current_is_single_threaded to determine if the current process is single-threaded but this call does not consider io_uring's io_worker threads thus it is possible to insert a time namespace's vvar page to process's memory space via a page fault.

CVE-2023-52989,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firewire: fix memory leak for payload of request subaction to IEC 61883-1 FCP region  This patch is fix for Linux kernel v2.6.33 or later.  For request subaction to IEC 61883-1 FCP region Linux FireWire subsystem have had an issue of use-after-free. The subsystem allows multiple user space listeners to the region while data of the payload was likely released before the listeners execute read(2) to access to it for copying to user space.  The issue was fixed by a commit 281e20323ab7 (firewire: core: fix use-after-free regression in FCP handler). The object of payload is duplicated in kernel space for each listener. When the listener executes ioctl(2) with FW_CDEV_IOC_SEND_RESPONSE request the object is going to be released.  However it causes memory leak since the commit relies on call of release_request() in drivers/firewire/core-cdev.c. Against the expectation the function is never called due to the design of release_client_resource(). The function delegates release task to caller when called with non-NULL fourth argument. The implementation of ioctl_send_response() is the case. It should release the object explicitly.  This commit fixes the bug.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-53267,sigstore-java is a sigstore java client for interacting with sigstore infrastructure. sigstore-java has insufficient verification for a situation where a validly-signed but mismatched bundle is presented as proof of inclusion into a transparency log. This bug impacts clients using any variation of KeylessVerifier.verify(). The verifier may accept a bundle with an unrelated log entry cryptographically verifying everything but fails to ensure the log entry applies to the artifact in question thereby verifying a bundle without any proof the signing event was logged. This allows the creation of a bundle without fulcio certificate and private key combined with an unrelated but time-correct log entry to fake logging of a signing event. A malicious actor using a compromised identity may want to do this to prevent discovery via rekor's log monitors. The signer's identity will still be available to the verifier. The signature on the bundle must still be on the correct artifact for the verifier to pass. sigstore-gradle-plugin and sigstore-maven-plugin are not affected by this as they only provide signing functionality. This issue has been patched in v1.1.0 release with PR #856. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.5,CWE-347
