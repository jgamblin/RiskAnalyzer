CVE-2024-25619,Mastodon is a free open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. When an OAuth Application is destroyed the streaming server wasn't being informed that the Access Tokens had also been destroyed this could have posed security risks to users by allowing an application to continue listening to streaming after the application had been destroyed. Essentially this comes down to the fact that when Doorkeeper sets up the relationship between Applications and Access Tokens it uses a `dependent: delete_all` configuration which means the `after_commit` callback setup on `AccessTokenExtension` didn't actually fire since `delete_all` doesn't trigger ActiveRecord callbacks. To mitigate we need to add a `before_destroy` callback to `ApplicationExtension` which announces to streaming that all the Application's Access Tokens are being killed. Impact should be negligible given the affected application had to be owned by the user. None the less this issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6 4.1.14 4.0.14 and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability.,3.1,CWE-613

CVE-2021-47010,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: Only allow init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted algo  tcp_set_default_congestion_control() is netns-safe in that it writes to &net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control but it also sets ca->flags |= TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced. This has the unintended side-effect of changing the global net.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_control sysctl despite the fact that it is read-only: 97684f0970f6 (net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init netns)  Resolve this netns leak by only allowing the init netns to set the default algorithm to one that is restricted.

CVE-2022-48975,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: fix memory leak in gpiochip_setup_dev()  Here is a backtrace report about memory leak detected in gpiochip_setup_dev():  unreferenced object 0xffff88810b406400 (size 512):   comm python3 pid 1682 jiffies 4295346908 (age 24.090s)   backtrace:     kmalloc_trace     device_add		device_private_init at drivers/base/core.c:3361 			(inlined by) device_add at drivers/base/core.c:3411     cdev_device_add     gpiolib_cdev_register     gpiochip_setup_dev     gpiochip_add_data_with_key  gcdev_register() & gcdev_unregister() would call device_add() & device_del() (no matter CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is enabled or not) to register/unregister device.  However if device_add() succeeds some resource (like struct device_private allocated by device_private_init()) is not released by device_del().  Therefore after device_add() succeeds by gcdev_register() it needs to call put_device() to release resource in the error handle path.  Here we move forward the register of release function and let it release every piece of resource by put_device() instead of kfree().  While at it fix another subtle issue i.e. when gc->ngpio is equal to 0 we still call kcalloc() and in case of further error kfree() on the ZERO_PTR pointer which is not NULL. It's not a bug per se but rather waste of the resources and potentially wrong expectation about contents of the gdev->descs variable.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2023-22735,Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. In versions of zulip prior to commit `2f6c5a8` but after commit `04cf68b` users could upload files with arbitrary `Content-Type` which would be served from the Zulip hostname with `Content-Disposition: inline` and no `Content-Security-Policy` header allowing them to trick other users into executing arbitrary Javascript in the context of the Zulip application.  Among other things this enables session theft. Only deployments which use the S3 storage (not the local-disk storage) are affected and only deployments which deployed commit 04cf68b45ebb5c03247a0d6453e35ffc175d55da which has only been in `main` not any numbered release. Users affected should upgrade from main again to deploy this fix.
