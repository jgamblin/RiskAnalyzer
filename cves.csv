CVE-2023-49803,@koa/cors npm provides Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for koa a web framework for Node.js. Prior to version 5.0.0 the middleware operates in a way that if an allowed origin is not provided it will return an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with the value of the origin from the request. This behavior completely disables one of the most crucial elements of browsers - the Same Origin Policy (SOP) this could cause a very serious security threat to the users of this middleware. If such behavior is expected for instance when middleware is used exclusively for prototypes and not for production applications it should be heavily emphasized in the documentation along with an indication of the risks associated with such behavior as many users may not be aware of it. Version 5.0.0 fixes this vulnerability.,8.6,CWE-346
CVE-2023-30553,Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to multiple SQL injections in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value and the `full_sql` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed to the methods that follow in given SQL engine implementations which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are `execute_check` in `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` `query` method `execute_check` in `sql/engines/goinception.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py` `query` method `execute_check` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which passes unsafe user input into the `object_name_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py` which in turn is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-102`.,6.5,CWE-89
CVE-2023-35944,Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Envoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2 however some internal scheme checks are case-sensitive.

CVE-2023-46233,crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version 4.2.0 crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993 and at least 1300000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1 a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005 and defaults to one single iteration a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords the impact is high. If used to generate signatures the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at least 250000 iterations.,9.1,CWE-328

CVE-2021-47261,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  IB/mlx5: Fix initializing CQ fragments buffer  The function init_cq_frag_buf() can be called to initialize the current CQ fragments buffer cq->buf or the temporary cq->resize_buf that is filled during CQ resize operation.  However the offending commit started to use function get_cqe() for getting the CQEs the issue with this change is that get_cqe() always returns CQEs from cq->buf which leads us to initialize the wrong buffer and in case of enlarging the CQ we try to access elements beyond the size of the current cq->buf and eventually hit a kernel panic.

CVE-2023-4039,**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains  that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer  overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application  without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.  The default behavior when the stack-protector  detects an overflow is to terminate your application resulting in  controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer  overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change  program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to  go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

CVE-2024-53131,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepoint  Patch series nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref bugs on block tracepoints.  This series fixes null pointer dereference bugs that occur when using nilfs2 and two block-related tracepoints.   This patch (of 2):  It has been reported that when using block:block_touch_buffer tracepoint touch_buffer() called from __nilfs_get_folio_block() causes a NULL pointer dereference or a general protection fault when KASAN is enabled.  This happens because since the tracepoint was added in touch_buffer() it references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev regardless of whether the buffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the current implementation the block_device structure is set after the function returns to the caller.  Here touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer head as accessed but the common search helper for folio/page used by the caller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it was reimplemented a long time ago eliminating the need to call touch_buffer() here in the first place.  So this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-56619,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()  Syzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the inode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value memory access outside the folio/page range may occur or a use-after-free bug may be detected if KASAN is enabled.  This is because nilfs_last_byte() which is called by nilfs_find_entry() and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a page from i_size and the page index loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit size information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which the i_size value is assigned.  This caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry() resulting in memory access that exceeds the folio/page size.  Fix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit loss from unsigned int to u64.  The return value of nilfs_last_byte() is also of type unsigned int but it is truncated so as not to exceed PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs so no change is required.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-53259,quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO the kernel would then return a message too large error on sendmsg i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC) the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially this can be done after completion of the handshake thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.,6.5,CWE-345

CVE-2024-53088,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state  Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN filters by setting mac and port VLAN.  1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan(). 2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac(). 3. Subsequently i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters() which         refers to the already freed filter memory causing corruption.  Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn multiple VFs. 2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change         MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host. 3. Observe errors in dmesg: Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX 	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX.  Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.  The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list. These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but must be removed using the full process.,4.7,CWE-362
