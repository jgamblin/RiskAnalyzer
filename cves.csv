CVE-2022-41874,Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. In versions prior to 1.0.7 and 1.1.2 Tauri is vulnerable to an Incorrectly-Resolved Name. Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality it is possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope definition. It is not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths as the issue is limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed paths. The impact differs on Windows MacOS and Linux due to different specifications of valid path characters. This bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files as user selected paths are automatically added to the allow list at runtime. A successful bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files.

CVE-2024-47056,SummaryThis advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where sensitive .env configuration files may be directly accessible via a web browser. This exposure could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information including database credentials API keys and other critical system configurations.  Sensitive Information Disclosure via .env File Exposure: The .env file which typically contains environment variables and sensitive application configurations is directly accessible via a web browser due to missing web server configurations that restrict access to such files. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to view the contents of this file by simply navigating to its URL.  MitigationUpdate Mautic to the latest Mautic version.  By default Mautic does not use .env files for production data.  For Apache users: Ensure your web server is configured to respect .htaccess files.  For Nginx users: As Nginx does not inherently support .htaccess files you must manually add a configuration block to your Nginx server configuration to deny access to .env files. Add the following to your Nginx configuration for the Mautic site:  location ~ /\.env {     deny all; }      After modifying your Nginx configuration remember to reload or restart your Nginx service for the changes to take effect.,5.1,CWE-312

CVE-2024-56695,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'  The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable which could lead to stack overflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc` thereby reducing the stack size.  This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space  in scenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is freed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory leaks.  Fixes the below with gcc W=1: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function ‘kfd_get_cu_occupancy’: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]   322 | }       | ^,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2025-24015,Deno is a JavaScript TypeScript and WebAssembly runtime. Versions 1.46.0 through 2.1.6 have an issue that affects AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM in Deno in which the authentication tag is not being validated. This means tampered ciphertexts or incorrect keys might not be detected which breaks the guarantees expected from AES-GCM. Older versions of Deno correctly threw errors in such cases as does Node.js. Without authentication tag verification AES-GCM degrades to essentially CTR mode removing integrity protection.

CVE-2024-56668,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain  The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While for nested parent domain it is missed. Hence when trying to map pages to the nested parent NULL dereference occurred. Also there is potential memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation.  To solve it add a helper for qi_batch allocation and call it in both the __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().

CVE-2025-24787,WhoDB is an open source database management tool. In affected versions the application is vulnerable to parameter injection in database connection strings which allows an attacker to read local files on the machine the application is running on. The application uses string concatenation to build database connection URIs which are then passed to corresponding libraries responsible for setting up the database connections. This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user in many cases to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true` the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one) the attacker is able to read local files. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,8.6,CWE-943
