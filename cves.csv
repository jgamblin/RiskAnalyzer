CVE-2024-58093,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal  Before 456d8aa37d0f (PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to avoid use-after-free) we would free the ASPM link only after the last function on the bus pertaining to the given link was removed.  That was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function link->downstream would point to free'd memory after.  After above change we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function removal on the bus pertaining to a given link.  That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream port then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.  The resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug because pciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.  On that switch function 0 is the virtual P2P bridge to the internal bus. Free exactly when function 0 is removed -- before the parent link is obsolete but after all subordinate links are gone.  [kwilczynski: commit log],7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2025-64101,Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to 4.6.0 3.4.3 and 2.71.18 a potential vulnerability exists in ZITADEL's password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link containing a secret code is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g. via host header injection) they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. It's important to note that this specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.6.0 3.4.3 and 2.71.18.,8.1,CWE-601

CVE-2023-45133,Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse` using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any polyfill provider plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2 `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2 `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3 `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6 `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5 `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0 `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.,9.3,CWE-184

CVE-2024-28255,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.,9.8,CWE-287

CVE-2022-24731,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.5.0 but before versions 2.1.11 2.2.6 and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability allowing a malicious user with read/write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `create` or `update` access to Applications can leak the contents of any text file on the repo-server. By crafting a malicious Helm chart and using it in an Application the attacker can retrieve the sensitive file's contents either as part of the generated manifests or in an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from another Application's source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11 2.2.6 and 2.3.0. The problem can be mitigated by avoiding storing secrets in git avoiding mounting secrets as files on the repo-server avoiding decrypting secrets into files on the repo-server and carefully limiting who can `create` or `update` Applications.,6.8,CWE-22

CVE-2023-52447,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary  When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab the map may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program. However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map directly through bpf_map_put() if the ref-counter is the last one (which is true for most cases) the inner map will be freed by ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now most .map_free() callbacks don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a RCU grace period so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur use-after-free problem.  Fix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both one RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner map has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is accomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to reduce the size of bpf_map.,6.7,CWE-416
