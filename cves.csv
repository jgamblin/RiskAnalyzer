CVE-2025-4598,A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump allowing the attacker to read sensitive data such as /etc/shadow content loaded by the original process.  A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary affecting data confidentiality.,4.7,CWE-364

CVE-2021-32732,### Impact It's possible to know if a user has or not an account in a wiki related to an email address and which username(s) is actually tied to that email by forging a request to the Forgot username page.

Two different patches are provided: - a first one to fix the CSRF problem - a more complex one that now relies on sending an email for the Forgot username process. ### Workarounds It's possible to fix the problem without uprading by editing the ForgotUsername page in version below 13.x to use the following code: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/69548c0320cbd772540cf4668743e69f879812cf/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-administration/xwiki-platform-administration-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/ForgotUsername.xml#L39-L123 In version after 13.x it's also possible to edit manually the forgotusername.vm file but it's really encouraged to upgrade the version here. ### References * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18384 * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18408 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org) * Email us at [security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org),7.5,CWE-352

CVE-2024-35221,Rubygems.org is the Ruby community's gem hosting service. A Gem publisher can cause a Remote DoS when publishing a Gem. This is due to how Ruby reads the Manifest of Gem files when using Gem::Specification.from_yaml. from_yaml makes use of SafeYAML.load which allows YAML aliases inside the YAML-based metadata of a gem. YAML aliases allow for Denial of Service attacks with so-called `YAML-bombs` (comparable to Billion laughs attacks). This was patched. There is is no action required by users.

CVE-2025-54410,Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine Mirantis Container Runtime and various other downstream projects/products. A firewalld vulnerability affects Moby releases before 28.0.0. When firewalld reloads Docker fails to re-create iptables rules that isolate bridge networks allowing any container to access all ports on any other container across different bridge networks on the same host. This breaks network segmentation between containers that should be isolated creating significant risk in multi-tenant environments. Only containers in --internal networks remain protected. Workarounds include reloading firewalld and either restarting the docker daemon re-creating bridge networks or using rootless mode. Maintainers anticipate a fix for this issue in version 25.0.13.,3.3,CWE-909

CVE-2023-28444,angular-server-side-configuration helps configure an angular application at runtime on the server or in a docker container via environment variables. angular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory. During deployment of an Angular based app the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file). With version 15.0.0 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json which would then be populated and exposed via index.html. This has NO IMPACT in a plain Angular project that has no backend component. This vulnerability has been mitigated in version 15.1.0 by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default. As a workaround manually edit or create ngssc.json or run script after ngssc.json generation. ,9.9,CWE-200

CVE-2022-31108,Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to load a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions such as clicking on a link etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is adequately escaped before embedding it in CSS blocks.,4.1,CWE-74
