CVE-2024-21629,Rust EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine interpreter. In `rust-evm` a feature called `record_external_operation` was introduced allowing library users to record custom gas changes. This feature can have some bogus interactions with the call stack. In particular during finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2` in the case that the substack execution happens successfully `rust-evm` will first commit the substate and then call `record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If `record_external_operation` later fails this error is returned to the parent call stack instead of `Succeeded`. Yet the substate commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to commit state changes when the parent caller contract receives zero address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed). This issue only impacts library users with custom `record_external_operation` that returns errors. The issue is patched in release 0.41.1. No known workarounds are available.,5.9,CWE-703

CVE-2022-30319,Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 allows Authentication bypass. According to FSCT-2022-0062 there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus authentication bypass issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication functions on the basis of a MAC/IP whitelist with inactivity timeout to which an authenticated client's MAC/IP is stored. UDP traffic can be spoofed to bypass the whitelist-based access control. Since UDP is stateless an attacker capable of passively observing traffic can spoof arbitrary messages using the MAC/IP of an authenticated client. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.,8.1,CWE-290

CVE-2024-50005,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker  In the `mac802154_scan_worker` function the `scan_req->type` field was accessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According to RCU usage rules this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable behavior such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.  This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.  To address this the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU rules.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-56828,File Upload vulnerability in ChestnutCMS through 1.5.0. Based on the code analysis it was determined that the /api/member/avatar API endpoint receives a base64 string as input. This string is then passed to the memberService.uploadAvatarByBase64 method for processing. Within the service the base64-encoded image is parsed. For example given a string like: data:image/html;base64PGh0bWw+PGltZyBzcmM9eCBvbmVycm9yPWFsZXJ0KDEpPjwvaHRtbD4= the content after the comma is extracted and decoded using Base64.getDecoder().decode(). The substring from the 11th character up to the first occurrence of a semicolon (;) is assigned to the suffix variable (representing the file extension). The decoded content is then written to a file. However the file extension is not validated and since this functionality is exposed to the frontend it poses significant security risks.,9.8,CWE-434

CVE-2024-8270,The macOS Rocket.Chat application is affected by a vulnerability that allows bypassing  Transparency Consent and Control (TCC) policies enabling the exploitation or abuse of permissions specified in its entitlements (e.g. microphone camera automation network client). Since Rocket.Chat was not signed with the Hardened Runtime nor set to enforce Library Validation it is vulnerable to DYLIB injection attacks which can lead to unauthorized actions or escalation of permissions. Consequently an attacker gains capabilities that are not permitted by default under the Sandbox and its application profile.,5.5,CWE-863

CVE-2022-20840,Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.         These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted input into various data fields in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information. In some cases it is also possible to cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard.,4.8,CWE-79
