CVE-2025-46722,vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). In versions starting from 0.7.0 to before 0.9.0 in the file vllm/multimodal/hasher.py the MultiModalHasher class has a security and data integrity issue in its image hashing method.

CVE-2024-28859,Symfony1 is a community fork of symfony 1.4 with DIC form enhancements latest Swiftmailer better performance composer compatible and PHP 8 support. Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However it is possible to include any object type in `$this->_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.0,CWE-502

CVE-2025-23028,Cilium is a networking observability and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. A denial of service vulnerability affects versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7 1.15.0 through 1.15.11 and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4. In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS traffic an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads from outside the cluster. For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads that have DNS-based policy configured existing connections may continue to operate and new connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established but new connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to restart. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18 v1.15.12 and v1.16.5. No known workarounds are available.,5.3,CWE-770

CVE-2021-47008,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating  Access to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the GHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCB might not be mapped.  The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered. However if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold then the GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT) which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.  The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about any errors. While it is likely that the GHCB will be mapped in this situation add a safe guard in this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered.,5.5,CWE-476
CVE-2024-55894,TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework. A vulnerability has been identified in the backend user interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically this functionality is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally state-changing actions in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not enforce the appropriate HTTP method. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and to be deceived into interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend which can occur under the following conditions: The user opens a malicious link such as one sent via email. The user visits a compromised or manipulated website while the following settings are misconfigured: 1. `security.backend.enforceReferrer` feature is disabled 2. `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to lax or none. The vulnerability in the affected downstream component “Backend User Module” allows attackers to initiate password resets for other backend users or to terminate their user sessions.

CVE-2022-21682,Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified in the manifest so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done so this is not problem. However if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization which can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use the only issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write permissions. However a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.,7.7,CWE-22

CVE-2022-36065,GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29 attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string.
