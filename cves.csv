CVE-2023-52566,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential use after free in nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data()  In nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data() brelse(bh) is called to drop the reference count of bh when the call to nilfs_dat_translate() fails.  If the reference count hits 0 and its owner page gets unlocked bh may be freed.  However bh->b_page is dereferenced to put the page after that which may result in a use-after-free bug.  This patch moves the release operation after unlocking and putting the page.  NOTE: The function in question is only called in GC and in combination with current userland tools address translation using DAT does not occur in that function so the code path that causes this issue will not be executed.  However it is possible to run that code path by intentionally modifying the userland GC library or by calling the GC ioctl directly.

CVE-2024-28253,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. `CompiledRule::validateExpression` is also called from `PolicyRepository.prepare`. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which in turn gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`.

CVE-2024-23331,Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. The Vite dev server option `server.fs.deny` can be bypassed on case-insensitive file systems using case-augmented versions of filenames. Notably this affects servers hosted on Windows. This bypass is similar to CVE-2023-34092 -- with surface area reduced to hosts having case-insensitive filesystems. Since `picomatch` defaults to case-sensitive glob matching but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist bypass is possible. By requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented casing the matcher derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to block access to sensitive files. This issue has been addressed in vite@5.0.12 vite@4.5.2 vite@3.2.8 and vite@2.9.17. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to dev servers.,7.5,CWE-178

CVE-2022-24363,This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader 11.1.0.52543. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-15861.,8.8,CWE-416
CVE-2024-42231,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zoned: fix calc_available_free_space() for zoned mode  calc_available_free_space() returns the total size of metadata (or system) block groups which can be allocated from unallocated disk space. The logic is wrong on zoned mode in two places.  First the calculation of data_chunk_size is wrong. We always allocate one zone as one chunk and no partial allocation of a zone. So we should use zone_size (= data_sinfo->chunk_size) as it is.  Second the result avail may not be zone aligned. Since we always allocate one zone as one chunk on zoned mode returning non-zone size aligned bytes will result in less pressure on the async metadata reclaim process.  This is serious for the nearly full state with a large zone size device. Allowing over-commit too much will result in less async reclaim work and end up in ENOSPC. We can align down to the zone size to avoid that.,5.5,CWE-682
