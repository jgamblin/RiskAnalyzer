CVE-2024-47698,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: media: dvb-frontends/rtl2832: fix an out-of-bounds write error  Ensure index in rtl2832_pid_filter does not exceed 31 to prevent out-of-bounds access.  dev->filters is a 32-bit value so set_bit and clear_bit functions should only operate on indices from 0 to 31. If index is 32 it will attempt to access a non-existent 33rd bit leading to out-of-bounds access. Change the boundary check from index > 32 to index >= 32 to resolve this issue.

CVE-2022-39367,QTIWorks is a software suite for standards-based assessment delivery. Prior to version 1.0-beta15 the QTIWorks Engine allows users to upload QTI content packages as ZIP files. The ZIP handling code does not sufficiently check the paths of files contained within ZIP files so can insert files into other locations in the filesystem if they are writable by the process running the QTIWorks Engine. In extreme cases this could allow anonymous users to change files in arbitrary locations in the filesystem. In normal QTIWorks Engine deployments the impact is somewhat reduced because the default QTIWorks configuration does not enable the public demo functionality so ZIP files can only be uploaded by users with instructor privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0-beta15. There are no database configuration changes required when upgrading to this version. No known workarounds for this issue exist.,8.6,CWE-22

CVE-2024-24819,icingaweb2-module-incubator is a working project of bleeding edge Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class `gipfl\Web\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form unless explicitly disabled but even if enabled the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which unknowingly interacts with a prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,5.3,CWE-352
CVE-2025-1465,A vulnerability which was classified as problematic was found in lmxcms 1.41. Affected is an unknown function of the file db.inc.php of the component Maintenance. The manipulation leads to code injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.,4.1,CWE-74
CVE-2024-38388,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda/cs_dsp_ctl: Use private_free for control cleanup  Use the control private_free callback to free the associated data block. This ensures that the memory won't leak whatever way the control gets destroyed.  The original implementation didn't actually remove the ALSA controls in hda_cs_dsp_control_remove(). It only freed the internal tracking structure. This meant it was possible to remove/unload the amp driver while leaving its ALSA controls still present in the soundcard. Obviously attempting to access them could cause segfaults or at least dereferencing stale pointers.,3.3,CWE-401
CVE-2023-2708,The Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘search_term’ parameter in versions up to and including 1.0.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

CVE-2024-36896,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal  Testing with KASAN and syzkaller revealed a bug in port.c:disable_store(): usb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL if the hub that the port belongs to is concurrently removed but the function does not check for this possibility before dereferencing the returned value.
