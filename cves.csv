CVE-2024-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid use-after-free in ext4_ext_show_leaf()  In ext4_find_extent() path may be freed by error or be reallocated so using a previously saved *ppath may have been freed and thus may trigger use-after-free as follows:  ext4_split_extent   path = *ppath;   ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)   path = ext4_find_extent(ppath)   ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)     // ext4_find_extent fails to free path     // but zeroout succeeds   ext4_ext_show_leaf(inode path)     eh = path[depth].p_hdr     // path use-after-free !!!  Similar to ext4_split_extent_at() we use *ppath directly as an input to ext4_ext_show_leaf(). Fix a spelling error by the way.  Same problem in ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(). Since 'path' is only used in ext4_ext_show_leaf() remove 'path' and use *ppath directly.

CVE-2023-24871,Windows Bluetooth Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,8.8,CWE-190
CVE-2022-29245,SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1 during an `X25519` key exchange the client’s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host during the X25519 key exchange the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.,6.5,CWE-338

CVE-2023-25577,Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version 2.2.3 Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data` `request.form` `request.files` or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)` it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously this can exhaust or kill all available workers. Version 2.2.3 contains a patch for this issue.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2025-25297,Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0 Label Studio's S3 storage integration feature contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in its endpoint configuration. When creating an S3 storage connection the application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint URL via the s3_endpoint parameter. This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3 AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions on the protocol or destination. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application send HTTP requests to arbitrary internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint. When the storage sync operation is triggered the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response in error messages. This SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages from failed requests contain the full response body allowing data exfiltration from internal services. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.,8.6,CWE-918

CVE-2025-38595,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen: fix UAF in dmabuf_exp_from_pages()  [dma_buf_fd() fixes; no preferences regarding the tree it goes through - up to xen folks]  As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table another thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race but it's a userland race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However if we follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed by its ->release()) we have a UAF.  dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install(). gntdev dmabuf_exp_from_pages() calls it and then proceeds to access the objects destroyed on close - starting with gntdev_dmabuf itself.  Fix that by doing reserving descriptor before anything else and do fd_install() only when everything had been set up.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2024-41066,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak  Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during transmit:     tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;     free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;     consumer_index ++; Where variable data looks like this:     free_map == [4 IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP 0 3]                                                	consumer_index^     tx_buff == [skb=null skb=<ptr> skb=<ptr> skb=null skb=null]  The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed to an unused/null skb address. So if by some chance our free_map and tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop sending packets eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.  Therefore add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.,5.5,CWE-401
