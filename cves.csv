CVE-2024-45229,The Versa Director offers REST APIs for orchestration and management. By design certain APIs such as the login screen banner display and device registration do not require authentication. However it was discovered that for Directors directly connected to the Internet one of these APIs can be exploited by injecting invalid arguments into a GET request potentially exposing the authentication tokens of other currently logged-in users. These tokens can then be used to invoke additional APIs on port 9183. This exploit does not disclose any username or password information.     Currently there are no workarounds in Versa Director. However if there is Web Application Firewall (WAF) or API Gateway fronting the Versa Director it can be used to block access to the URLs of vulnerable API.  /vnms/devicereg/device/* (on ports 9182 & 9183) and /versa/vnms/devicereg/device/* (on port 443). Versa recommends that Directors be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions. This vulnerability is not exploitable on Versa Directors not exposed to the Internet.We have validated that no Versa-hosted head ends have been affected by this vulnerability. Please contact Versa Technical Support or Versa account team for any further assistance.,6.6,CWE-306

CVE-2023-5123,The JSON datasource plugin ( https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/ ) is a Grafana Labs maintained plugin for Grafana that allows for retrieving and processing JSON data from a remote endpoint (including a specific sub-path) configured by an administrator. Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter it was possible to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path.                                                          This means that if the datasource was configured by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ ) it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues queries containing path traversal characters which would in turn cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/) .  In the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana instance itself this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials resulting in the potential for privilege escalation hence the high score for this vulnerability.,8.0,CWE-22

CVE-2024-26998,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: core: Clearing the circular buffer before NULLifying it  The circular buffer is NULLified in uart_tty_port_shutdown() under the spin lock. However the PM or other timer based callbacks may still trigger after this event without knowning that buffer pointer is not valid. Since the serial code is a bit inconsistent in checking the buffer state (some rely on the head-tail positions some on the buffer pointer) it's better to have both aligned i.e. buffer pointer to be NULL and head-tail possitions to be the same meaning it's empty. This will prevent asynchronous calls to dereference NULL pointer as reported recently in 8250 case:    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference address: 00000cf5   Workqueue: pm pm_runtime_work   EIP: serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)   ...   ? serial8250_tx_chars (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1809)   __start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1551)   serial8250_start_tx (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1654)   serial_port_runtime_suspend (include/linux/serial_core.h:667 drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:63)   __rpm_callback (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:393)   ? serial_port_remove (drivers/tty/serial/serial_port.c:50)   rpm_suspend (drivers/base/power/runtime.c:447)  The proposed change will prevent ->start_tx() to be called during suspend on shut down port.,5.5,CWE-476
