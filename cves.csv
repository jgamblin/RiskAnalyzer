CVE-2025-9824,ImpactThe attacker can validate if a user exists by checking the time login returns. This timing difference can be used to enumerate valid usernames after which an attacker could attempt brute force attacks.  PatchesThis vulnerability has been patched implementing a timing-safe form login authenticator that ensures consistent response times regardless of whether a user exists or not.  Technical DetailsThe vulnerability was caused by different response times when:    *  A valid username was provided (password hashing occurred)   *  An invalid username was provided (no password hashing occurred)   The fix introduces a TimingSafeFormLoginAuthenticator that performs a dummy password hash verification even for non-existent users ensuring consistent timing.  WorkaroundsNo workarounds are available. Users should upgrade to the patched version.

CVE-2024-58042,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rhashtable: Fix potential deadlock by moving schedule_work outside lock  Move the hash table growth check and work scheduling outside the rht lock to prevent a possible circular locking dependency.  The original implementation could trigger a lockdep warning due to a potential deadlock scenario involving nested locks between rhashtable bucket rq lock and dsq lock. By relocating the growth check and work scheduling after releasing the rth lock we break this potential deadlock chain.  This change expands the flexibility of rhashtable by removing restrictive locking that previously limited its use in scheduler and workqueue contexts.  Import to say that this calls rht_grow_above_75() which reads from struct rhashtable without holding the lock if this is a problem we can move the check to the lock and schedule the workqueue after the lock.   Modified so that atomic_inc is also moved outside of the bucket lock along with the growth above 75% check.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2024-47869,Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard` function.

CVE-2023-52638,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock  The following 3 locks would race against each other causing the deadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:  - j1939_socks_lock - active_session_list_lock - sk_session_queue_lock  A reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock since in the rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list that j1939_socks_lock is protecting the code does not attempt to acquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency where for example the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock and attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock and at the same time another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding sk_session_queue_lock.  NOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug reported by Syzbot; instead it solves a deadlock situation to prepare for one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug which appears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.
