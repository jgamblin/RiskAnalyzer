CVE-2024-50202,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()  Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing test for nilfs2.  The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry() which searches for directory entries ignores errors when loading a directory page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.  If the filesystem images is corrupted and the i_size of the directory inode is large and the directory page/folio is successfully read but fails the sanity check for example when it is zero-filled nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.  Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().  The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via nilfs_find_entry() so fix it together.,5.5,CWE-755

CVE-2023-52483,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mctp: perform route lookups under a RCU read-side lock  Our current route lookups (mctp_route_lookup and mctp_route_lookup_null) traverse the net's route list without the RCU read lock held.

CVE-2025-47281,Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. In versions 1.14.1 and below a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g. {{@ | non_existent_function }}). This leads to a nil value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions specifically getValueAsStringMap which expect string values results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (interface {} is nil not string). This crashes Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod. This is fixed in version 1.14.2.,7.7,CWE-20

CVE-2021-47282,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: bcm2835: Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slaves  Commit 571e31fa60b3 (spi: bcm2835: Cache CS register value for ->prepare_message()) limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile-time. The limitation was necessitated by a statically-sized array prepare_cs[] in the driver private data which contains a per-slave register value.  The commit sought to enforce the limitation at run-time by setting the controller's num_chipselect to 3:  Slaves with a higher chipselect are rejected by spi_add_device().  However the commit neglected that num_chipselect only limits the number of *native* chipselects.  If GPIO chipselects are specified in the device tree for more than 3 slaves num_chipselect is silently raised by of_spi_get_gpio_numbers() and the result are out-of-bounds accesses to the statically-sized array prepare_cs[].  As a bandaid fix which is backportable to stable raise the number of allowed slaves to 24 (which ought to be enough for anybody) enforce the limitation on slave ->setup and revert num_chipselect to 3 (which is the number of native chipselects supported by the controller). An upcoming for-next commit will allow an arbitrary number of slaves.,7.8,CWE-787

CVE-2023-42454,SQLpage is a SQL-only webapp builder. Someone using SQLpage versions prior to 0.11.1 whose SQLpage instance is exposed publicly with a database connection string specified in the `sqlpage/sqlpage.json` configuration file (not in an environment variable) with the web_root is the current working directory (the default) and with their database exposed publicly is vulnerable to an attacker retrieving database connection information from SQLPage and using it to connect to their database directly. Version 0.11.0 fixes this issue. Some workarounds are available. Using an environment variable instead of the configuration file to specify the database connection string prevents exposing it on vulnerable versions. Using a different web root (that is not a parent of the SQLPage configuration directory) fixes the issue. One should also avoid exposing one's database publicly.,10.0,CWE-200

CVE-2022-49814,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kcm: close race conditions on sk_receive_queue  sk->sk_receive_queue is protected by skb queue lock but for KCM sockets its RX path takes mux->rx_lock to protect more than just skb queue. However kcm_recvmsg() still only grabs the skb queue lock so race conditions still exist.  We can teach kcm_recvmsg() to grab mux->rx_lock too but this would introduce a potential performance regression as struct kcm_mux can be shared by multiple KCM sockets.  So we have to enforce skb queue lock in requeue_rx_msgs() and handle skb peek case carefully in kcm_wait_data(). Fortunately skb_recv_datagram() already handles it nicely and is widely used by other sockets we can just switch to skb_recv_datagram() after getting rid of the unnecessary sock lock in kcm_recvmsg() and kcm_splice_read(). Side note: SOCK_DONE is not used by KCM sockets so it is safe to get rid of this check too.  I ran the original syzbot reproducer for 30 min without seeing any issue.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2024-41664,Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network. Prior to `sha-8ea5315` Canarytokens.org was vulnerable to a blind SSRF in the Webhook alert feature. When a Canarytoken is created users choose to receive alerts either via email or via a webhook. If a webhook is supplied when a  Canarytoken is first created the site will make a test request to the supplied URL to ensure it accepts alert notification HTTP requests. No safety checks were performed on the URL leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. The SSRF is Blind because the content of the response is not displayed to the creating user; they are simply told whether an error occurred in making the test request. Using the Blind SSRF it was possible to map out open ports for IPs inside the Canarytokens.org infrastructure. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image or any Docker image after `sha-097d91a`.,5.4,CWE-918
