CVE-2024-48984,An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. When parsing hci reports the hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of a list of reports by reading a byte from an input stream. It then fetches the length of the first report uses it to calculate the beginning of the second report etc. In doing this it tracks the largest report so it can later allocate a buffer that fits every individual report (but only one at a time). It does not however validate that these addresses are all contained within the buffer passed to hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport. It is then possible though unlikely that the buffer designated to hold the reports is allocated in such a way that one of these out-of-bounds length fields is contained within the new buffer. When the (n-1)th report is copied it overwrites the length field of the nth report. This now corrupted length field is then used for a memcpy into the new buffer which may lead to a buffer overflow.,9.8,CWE-120

CVE-2022-49889,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()  On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space the ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs even though the CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the file the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to wake waiters as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.  While debugging this I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is OK to do) and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is not fine and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).

CVE-2021-46935,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels  In 4.13 commit 74310e06be4d (android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space) fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so the driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous transactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.  Unfortunately on the free side the accounting of async_free_space did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of async_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or less.  These small transactions are uncommon so this accounting issue has gone undetected for several years.  The fix is to use buffer_size (the allocated buffer size) instead of size (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space during the free operation. These are the same except for this corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes.,5.5,CWE-668

CVE-2024-46850,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn35_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()  dc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe context passed to dcn35_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.  If dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which calls dcn35_set_drr() at some point) we can end up using already nulled function callback fields of struct stream_resource.  The logic in dcn35_set_drr() already tries to avoid this by checking tg against NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and before the next access then we get a race.  Avoid this by copying tg first to a local variable and then use this variable for all the operations. This should work as long as nobody frees the resource pool where the timing generators live.

CVE-2022-50103,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched cpuset: Fix dl_cpu_busy() panic due to empty cs->cpus_allowed  With cgroup v2 the cpuset's cpus_allowed mask can be empty indicating that the cpuset will just use the effective CPUs of its parent. So cpuset_can_attach() can call task_can_attach() with an empty mask. This can lead to cpumask_any_and() returns nr_cpu_ids causing the call to dl_bw_of() to crash due to percpu value access of an out of bound CPU value.

Also update task_can_attach()'s 2nd argument name to cs_effective_cpus to reflect the change. In addition a check is added to task_can_attach() to guard against the possibility that cpumask_any_and() may return a value >= nr_cpu_ids.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2025-25184,Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.11 3.0.12 and 3.1.10 Rack::CommonLogger can be exploited by crafting input that includes newline characters to manipulate log entries. The supplied proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious content into logs. When a user provides the authorization credentials via Rack::Auth::Basic if success the username will be put in env['REMOTE_USER'] and later be used by Rack::CommonLogger for logging purposes. The issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white space characters or the server just want to log every login attempts. If an attacker enters a username with CRLF character the logger will log the malicious username with CRLF characters into the logfile. Attackers can break log formats or insert fraudulent entries potentially obscuring real activity or injecting malicious data into log files. Versions 2.2.11 3.0.12 and 3.1.10 contain a fix.,6.5,CWE-93
CVE-2024-50273,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list  At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF we delete the ref from its ref head's ref_add_list using list_del() which leaves the ref's add_list member not reinitialized as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2 respectively.  If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref which can happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction abort we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call list_empty() against the ref's add_list which returns false since the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison pointers resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences otherwise.  So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.,5.5,CWE-908
