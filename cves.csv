CVE-2023-47128,Piccolo is an object-relational mapping and query builder which supports asyncio. Prior to version 1.1.1 the handling of named transaction `savepoints` in all database implementations is vulnerable to SQL Injection via f-strings. While the likelihood of an end developer exposing a `savepoints` `name` parameter to a user is highly unlikely it would not be unheard of. If a malicious user was able to abuse this functionality they would have essentially direct access to the database and the ability to modify data to the level of permissions associated with the database user. A non exhaustive list of actions possible based on database permissions is: Read all data stored in the database including usernames and password hashes; insert arbitrary data into the database including modifying existing records; and gain a shell on the underlying server. Version 1.1.1 fixes this issue.,9.1,CWE-89

CVE-2024-52598,2FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate their security codes. Two interconnected vulnerabilities exist in version 5.4.1 a SSRF and URI validation bypass issue. The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally the library does some basic validation on the URI attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application as long as their content type is text based. If not the request is still sent but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.,7.5,CWE-79

CVE-2022-20892,Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W RV130 RV130W and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.,4.7,CWE-120

CVE-2024-22423,yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The patch that addressed CVE-2023-40581 attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes. However this escaping is not sufficient and still allows expansion of environment variables. Support for output template expansion in `--exec` along with this vulnerable behavior was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. It replaces them with `%%cd:~%` a variable that expands to nothing leaving only the leading percent. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also always be careful when using `--exec` because while this specific vulnerability has been patched using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath); if expansion in `--exec` is needed verify the fields you are using do not contain `` `|` or `&`; and/or instead of using `--exec` write the info json and load the fields from it instead.,8.3,CWE-78
CVE-2023-1289,A vulnerability was discovered in ImageMagick where a specially created SVG file loads itself and causes a segmentation fault. This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file that leads to a segmentation fault generating many trash files in /tmp resulting in a denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes it generates a lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the SVG file contains many render actions. In a denial of service attack if a remote attacker uploads an SVG file of size t ImageMagick generates files of size 103*t. If an attacker uploads a 100M SVG the server will generate about 10G.,5.5,CWE-20

CVE-2022-31166,XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform a generic wiki platform. Starting in versions 11.3.7 11.0.3 and 12.0RC1 it is possible to exploit a bug in XWikiRights resolution of groups to obtain privilege escalation. More specifically editing a right with the object editor leads to adding a supplementary empty value to groups which is then resolved as a reference to XWiki.WebHome page. Adding an XWikiGroup xobject to that page then transforms it to a group any user put in that group would then obtain the privileges related to the edited right. Note that this security issue is normally mitigated by the fact that XWiki.WebHome (and XWiki space in general) should be protected by default for edit rights. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.4 and 14.2RC1 to not consider anymore empty values in XWikiRights. It's possible to work around the problem by setting appropriate rights on XWiki.WebHome page to prevent users to edit it.,8.1,CWE-269
CVE-2022-39181, GLPI - Reports plugin for GLPI Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (RXSS). Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or emailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim the content is executed by the victim's browser.   ,6.1,CWE-79

CVE-2023-52456,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock  When using the serial port as RS485 port the tx statemachine is used to control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the TTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during userland application crash) imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission to be retriggered by the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx statemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in deadlock now and the TX_EN remains low making the interface useless.  imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure the state machine handling is reached and is properly set to WAIT_AFTER_SEND.,5.5,CWE-667
