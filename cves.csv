CVE-2024-47508,An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the PFE management daemon (evo-pfemand) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an authenticated network-based attacker to cause an FPC crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).When specific SNMP GET operations or specific low-priviledged CLI commands are executed a GUID resource leak will occur eventually leading to exhaustion and resulting in FPCs to hang. Affected FPCs need to be manually restarted to recover.  GUID exhaustion will trigger a syslog message like one of the following:  evo-pfemand[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ... evo-aftmand-zx[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ... The leak can be monitored by running the following command and taking note of the values in the rightmost column labeled Guids:      user@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand/evo-pfemand    In case one or more of these values are constantly increasing the leak is happening.  This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:      *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO   *  21.3 versions before 21.3R3-EVO;   *  21.4 versions before 22.1R2-EVO    *  22.1 versions before 22.1R1-S1-EVO 22.1R2-EVO.

CVE-2023-23939,Azure/setup-kubectl is a GitHub Action for installing Kubectl. This vulnerability only impacts versions before version 3. An insecure temporary creation of a file allows other actors on the Actions runner to replace the Kubectl binary created by this action because it is world writable. This Kubectl tool installer runs `fs.chmodSync(kubectlPath 777)` to set permissions on the Kubectl binary however this allows any local user to replace the Kubectl binary. This allows privilege escalation to the user that can also run kubectl most likely root. This attack is only possible if an attacker somehow breached the GitHub actions runner or if a user is utilizing an Action that maliciously executes this attack. This has been fixed and released in all versions `v3` and later. 775 permissions are used instead. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ,3.9,CWE-732

CVE-2024-32473,Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine Docker Desktop and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. In 26.0.0 IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses and (3) the interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or in the service configuration of a `compose` file.,4.7,CWE-668

The MCS endpoint (port 22623) provides ignition configuration used for bootstrapping Nodes and can include some sensitive data e.g. registry pull secrets. There are two scenarios where this data can be accessed. The first is on Baremetal OpenStack Ovirt Vsphere and KubeVirt deployments which do not have a separate internal API endpoint and allow access from outside the cluster to port 22623 from the standard OpenShift API Virtual IP address. The second is on cloud deployments when using unsupported network plugins which do not create iptables rules that prevent to port 22623. In this scenario the ignition config is exposed to all pods within the cluster and cannot be accessed externally.,3.7,CWE-287
CVE-2024-56555,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binder: fix OOB in binder_add_freeze_work()  In binder_add_freeze_work() we iterate over the proc->nodes with the proc->inner_lock held.

CVE-2024-28253,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. `CompiledRule::validateExpression` is also called from `PolicyRepository.prepare`. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which in turn gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`) it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and therefore after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method an attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/policies` which gets handled by `PolicyResource.createOrUpdate()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-252`.
