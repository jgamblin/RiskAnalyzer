CVE-2024-58007,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial number  On MSM8916 devices the serial number exposed in sysfs is constant and does not change across individual devices. It's always:    db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ cat serial_number   2644893864  The firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0 8) which does not have support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is an existing check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case but it's not correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM we need to make sure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds instead of comparing with the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916 devices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfo struct in SMEM.  Fix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend() so that the size of the field is also taken into account.,7.1,CWE-125

CVE-2022-3602,A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

CVE-2024-42240,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation  When BHI mitigation is enabled if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set then entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the clear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler (exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the entry_SYSENTER_compat() function.  To address this issue entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY after making sure the TF flag is cleared.  The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:    $ cat sysenter_step.c   int main()   { asm(pushf; pop %ax; bts $8%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter); }    $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c    $ ./sysenter_step   Segmentation fault (core dumped)  The program is expected to crash and the #DB handler will issue a warning.

CVE-2022-39382,Keystone is a headless CMS for Node.js — built with GraphQL and React.`@keystone-6/core@3.0.0 || 3.0.1` users that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger security-sensitive functionality in their production builds are vulnerable to `NODE_ENV` being inlined to `development` for user code irrespective of what your environment variables. If you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger security-sensitive functionality you are not impacted by this vulnerability. Any dependencies that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviors (optimizations security or otherwise) should still respect your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application's dependencies as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`) are typically not compiled as part of this process and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2 regression tests have been added for this vulnerability in #8063.,9.8,CWE-74

CVE-2024-36105,dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications. Prior to versions 1.6.15 1.7.15 and 1.8.1 Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
