CVE-2022-48821,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc: avoid double fput() on failed usercopy  If the copy back to userland fails for the FASTRPC_IOCTL_ALLOC_DMA_BUFF ioctl() we shouldn't assume that 'buf->dmabuf' is still valid. In fact dma_buf_fd() called fd_install() before i.e. consumed one reference leaving us with none.  Calling dma_buf_put() will therefore put a reference we no longer own leading to a valid file descritor table entry for an already released 'file' object which is a straight use-after-free.  Simply avoid calling dma_buf_put() and rely on the process exit code to do the necessary cleanup if needed i.e. if the file descriptor is still valid.,7.8,CWE-416

Valid commands with potentially unwanted consequences (delete project transfer credits etc.) could be invoked by an attacker that controls the content of an iframe running inside a Tauri app. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 1.6.7 and 2.0.0-beta.19.,5.9,CWE-284
CVE-2024-24827,Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb` `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb` `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server.,5.3,CWE-400

CVE-2024-31988,XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 13.9-rc-1 and prior to versions 4.10.19 15.5.4 and 15.10-rc-1 when the realtime editor is installed in XWiki it allows arbitrary remote code execution with the interaction of an admin user with programming right. More precisely by getting an admin user to either visit a crafted URL or to view an image with this URL that could be in a comment the attacker can get the admin to execute arbitrary XWiki syntax including scripting macros with Groovy or Python code. This compromises the confidentiality integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.19 15.5.4 and 15.9. As a workaround one may update `RTFrontend.ConvertHTML` manually with the patch. This will however break some synchronization processes in the realtime editor so upgrading should be the preferred way on installations where this editor is used.,9.6,CWE-352

CVE-2024-28255,OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery observability and governance powered by a central metadata repository in-depth lineage and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.,9.8,CWE-287
CVE-2024-43515,Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) Denial of Service Vulnerability,7.5,CWE-400
CVE-2024-0727,Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack  Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted sources might terminate abruptly.  A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue.  OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse() PKCS12_unpack_p7data() PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata() PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass().  We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.  The FIPS modules in 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-10978,Incorrect privilege assignment in PostgreSQL allows a less-privileged application user to view or change different rows from those intended.  An attack requires the application to use SET ROLE SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION or an equivalent feature.  The problem arises when an application query uses parameters from the attacker or conveys query results to the attacker.  If that query reacts to current_setting('role') or the current user ID it may modify or return data as though the session had not used SET ROLE or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION.  The attacker does not control which incorrect user ID applies.  Query text from less-privileged sources is not a concern here because SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION are not sandboxes for unvetted queries.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1 16.5 15.9 14.14 13.17 and 12.21 are affected.,4.2,CWE-266

CVE-2022-41947,DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture management validation analytics and visualization. Through various features of DHIS2 an authenticated user may be able to upload a file which includes embedded javascript. The user could then potentially trick another authenticated user to open the malicious file in a browser which would trigger the javascript code resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1 2.37.8.1 2.38.2.1 2.39.0.1. Users unable to upgrade may add the following simple CSP rule in your web proxy to the vulnerable endpoints: `script-src 'none'`. This workaround will prevent all javascript from running on those endpoints.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2023-52498,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code  It is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core code deadlocks because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a requisite supplier device's one for example).  Address this by changing the code in question to use async_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly run them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.,5.5,CWE-667
