CVE-2021-46969,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: mhi: core: Fix invalid error returning in mhi_queue  mhi_queue returns an error when the doorbell is not accessible in the current state. This can happen when the device is in non M0 state like M3 and needs to be waken-up prior ringing the DB. This case is managed earlier by triggering an asynchronous M3 exit via controller resume/suspend callbacks that in turn will cause M0 transition and DB update.  So since it's not an error but just delaying of doorbell update there is no reason to return an error.  This also fixes a use after free error for skb case indeed a caller queuing skb will try to free the skb if the queueing fails but in that case queueing has been done.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-52497,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression  Currently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplace decompression that was used to handle the cases that some pages of compressed data are actually not in-place I/O.  However like most simple LZ77 algorithms LZ4 expects the compressed data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and it explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:   __________________________________________________________  |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|  Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this it typically maps two individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain. Previously it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem to completely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reported that EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor. After some analysis it seems that recent x86 processors with the new FSRM feature expose this issue with rep movsb.  Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace decompression for now.  Later as an useful improvement we could try to tie up these two buffers together in the correct order.,6.1,CWE-787

CVE-2023-45143,Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client written from scratch for Node.js. Prior to version 5.26.2 Undici already cleared Authorization headers on cross-origin redirects but did not clear `Cookie` headers. By design `cookie` headers are forbidden request headers disallowing them to be set in RequestInit.headers in browser environments.

As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a third-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the third party site. This was patched in version 5.26.2. There are no known workarounds.,3.9,CWE-200

CVE-2023-41050,AccessControl provides a general security framework for use in Zope. Python's format functionality allows someone controlling the format string to read objects accessible (recursively) via attribute access and subscription from accessible objects. Those attribute accesses and subscriptions use Python's full blown `getattr` and `getitem` not the policy restricted `AccessControl` variants `_getattr_` and `_getitem_`. This can lead to critical information disclosure. `AccessControl` already provides a safe variant for `str.format` and denies access to `string.Formatter`. However `str.format_map` is still unsafe. Affected are all users who allow untrusted users to create `AccessControl` controlled Python code and execute it. A fix has been introduced in versions 4.4 5.8 and 6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,6.8,CWE-200

CVE-2021-47199,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: CT Fix multiple allocations and memleak of mod acts  CT clear action offload adds additional mod hdr actions to the flow's original mod actions in order to clear the registers which hold ct_state. When such flow also includes encap action a neigh update event can cause the driver to unoffload the flow and then reoffload it.  Each time this happens the ct clear handling adds that same set of mod hdr actions to reset ct_state until the max of mod hdr actions is reached.  Also the driver never releases the allocated mod hdr actions and causing a memleak.  Fix above two issues by moving CT clear mod acts allocation into the parsing actions phase and only use it when offloading the rule.
