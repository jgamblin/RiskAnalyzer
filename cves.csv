CVE-2023-30553,Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to multiple SQL injections in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value and the `full_sql` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed to the methods that follow in given SQL engine implementations which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are `execute_check` in `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` `query` method `execute_check` in `sql/engines/goinception.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py` `query` method `execute_check` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which passes unsafe user input into the `object_name_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py` which in turn is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-102`.,6.5,CWE-89

CVE-2025-27789,Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers` and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.,6.2,CWE-1333

CVE-2023-43656,matrix-hookshot is a Matrix bot for connecting to external services like GitHub GitLab JIRA and more. Instances that have enabled transformation functions (those that have `generic.allowJsTransformationFunctions` in their config) may be vulnerable to an attack where it is possible to break out of the `vm2` sandbox and as a result Hookshot will be vulnerable to this. This problem is only likely to affect users who have allowed untrusted users to apply their own transformation functions. If you have only enabled a limited set of trusted users this threat is reduced (though not eliminated). Version 4.5.0 and above of hookshot include a new sandbox library which should better protect users. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable `generic.allowJsTransformationFunctions` in the config.,5.6,CWE-74
CVE-2023-36838,An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the flow processing daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows a local authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

CVE-2024-47660,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsnotify: clear PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily  In some setups directories can have many (usually negative) dentries. Hence __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() function can take a significant amount of time. Since the bulk of this function happens under inode->i_lock this causes a significant contention on the lock when we remove the watch from the directory as the __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() call from fsnotify_recalc_mask() races with __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() calls from __fsnotify_parent() happening on children. This can lead upto softlockup reports reported by users.  Fix the problem by calling fsnotify_update_children_dentry_flags() to set PARENT_WATCHED flags only when parent starts watching children.  When parent stops watching children clear false positive PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily in __fsnotify_parent() for each accessed child.,4.7,CWE-362

CVE-2022-31194,DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-jspui is a UI component for DSpace. The JSPUI resumable upload implementations in SubmissionController and FileUploadRequest are vulnerable to multiple path traversal attacks allowing an attacker to create files/directories anywhere on the server writable by the Tomcat/DSpace user by modifying some request parameters during submission. This path traversal can only be executed by a user with special privileges (submitter rights). This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds. However this vulnerability cannot be exploited by an anonymous user or a basic user. The user must first have submitter privileges to at least one Collection and be able to determine how to modify the request parameters to exploit the vulnerability.,8.2,CWE-22

CVE-2024-35790,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: altmodes/displayport: create sysfs nodes as driver's default device attribute group  The DisplayPort driver's sysfs nodes may be present to the userspace before typec_altmode_set_drvdata() completes in dp_altmode_probe. This means that a sysfs read can trigger a NULL pointer error by deferencing dp->hpd in hpd_show or dp->lock in pin_assignment_show as dev_get_drvdata() returns NULL in those cases.  Remove manual sysfs node creation in favor of adding attribute group as default for devices bound to the driver.

CVE-2024-6119,Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g. TLS clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.  Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of service.  Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g. TLS clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the application program.  Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures dates ...) is not affected the denial of service can occur only when the application also specifies an expected DNS name Email address or IP address.  TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates and even when they do they generally don't perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected identity) but rather extract the presented identity after checking the certificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity of the issue is Moderate.  The FIPS modules in 3.3 3.2 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.,7.5,CWE-843

CVE-2025-32031,Apollo Gateway provides utilities for combining multiple GraphQL microservices into a single GraphQL endpoint. Prior to 2.10.1 a vulnerability in Apollo Gateway allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan specifically due to internal optimizations being frequently bypassed. The query planner includes an optimization that significantly speeds up planning for applicable GraphQL selections. However queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments can generate many selections where this optimization does not apply leading to significantly longer planning times. Because the query planner does not enforce a timeout a small number of such queries can render gateway inoperable. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in @apollo/gateway version 2.10.1.,7.5,CWE-770
