CVE-2024-26654,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs  The dreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard->timer.  When the snd_pcm_substream is closing the aica_channel will be deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:        (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2) snd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |  ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker                                  |    mod_timer()   flush_work()                   |   del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer   kfree(dreamcastcard->channel)  |    schedule_work()                                  |  run_spu_dma() //worker   ...                            |    dreamcastcard->channel-> //USE  In order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases call mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma() then implement PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop op will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.,7.0,CWE-416

CVE-2024-21661,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13 2.9.9 and 2.10.4 an attacker can exploit a critical flaw in the application to initiate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack rendering the application inoperable and affecting all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an array in a multi-threaded environment. The vulnerability is rooted in the application's code where an array is being modified while it is being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes critically unsafe when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When two threads interact with the same array simultaneously the application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any attacker can crash the application continuously making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service.

CVE-2023-46842,Unlike 32-bit PV guests HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit and other modes.  This in particular means that they may set registers used to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range 32-bit code would be able to set them to.  When processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time the hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so involves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective registers.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves a certain amount of translation of the values.  Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a hypercall.  When this is found not to be the case it triggers a consistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash. ,6.5,CWE-843

CVE-2024-26995,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: tcpm: Correct the PDO counting in pd_set  Off-by-one errors happen because nr_snk_pdo and nr_src_pdo are incorrectly added one. The index of the loop is equal to the number of PDOs to be updated when leaving the loop and it doesn't need to be added one.  When doing the power negotiation TCPM relies on the nr_snk_pdo as the size of the local sink PDO array to match the Source capabilities of the partner port. If the off-by-one overflow occurs a wrong RDO might be sent and unexpected power transfer might happen such as over voltage or over current (than expected).  nr_src_pdo is used to set the Rp level when the port is in Source role. It is also the array size of the local Source capabilities when filling up the buffer which will be sent as the Source PDOs (such as in Power Negotiation). If the off-by-one overflow occurs a wrong Rp level might be set and wrong Source PDOs will be sent to the partner port. This could potentially cause over current or port resets.,7.8,CWE-193

CVE-2025-21744,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()  On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL pointer dereference occurs.  The following sequence deletes the interface:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_remove_interface()       brcmf_del_if()  Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.  After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is called providing the following sequence:    brcmf_detach()     brcmf_proto_detach()       brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()         brcmf_flowring_detach()           brcmf_msgbuf_delete_flowring()             brcmf_msgbuf_remove_flowring()               brcmf_flowring_delete()                 brcmf_get_ifp()                 brcmf_txfinalize()  Since brcmf_get_ip() can and actually will return NULL in this case the call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.  This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.  Although the NULL pointer dereference has only been seen when trying to update the tx statistic all other uses of the ifp pointer have been guarded as well with an early return if ifp is NULL.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2021-44850,On Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC devices physical modification of an SD boot image allows for a buffer overflow attack in the ROM. Because the Zynq-7000's boot image header is unencrypted and unauthenticated before use an attacker can modify the boot header stored on an SD card so that a secure image appears to be unencrypted and they will be able to modify the full range of register initialization values. Normally these registers will be restricted when booting securely. Of importance to this attack are two registers that control the SD card's transfer type and transfer size. These registers could be modified a way that causes a buffer overflow in the ROM.,6.8,CWE-345

CVE-2024-28244,KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\def` or `\newcommand` that causes a near-infinite loop despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX supports an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. Unfortunately support for Unicode (sub|super)script characters allows an attacker to bypass this limit. Each sub/superscript group instantiated a separate Parser with its own limit on macro executions without inheriting the current count of macro executions from its parent. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10.,6.5,CWE-674

CVE-2023-34095,cpdb-libs provides frontend and backend libraries for the Common Printing Dialog Backends (CPDB) project. In versions 1.0 through 2.0b4 cpdb-libs is vulnerable to buffer overflows via improper use of `scanf(3)`. cpdb-libs uses the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions to parse command lines and configuration files dropping the read string components into fixed-length buffers but does not limit the length of the strings to be read by `fscanf()` and `scanf()` causing buffer overflows when a string is longer than 1023 characters. A patch for this issue is available at commit f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7. As all buffers have a length of 1024 characters the patch limits the maximum string length to be read to 1023 by replacing all occurrences of `%s` with `%1023s` in all calls of the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions.,9.8,CWE-121
