CVE-2022-48894,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Don't unregister on shutdown  Similar to SMMUv2 this driver calls iommu_device_unregister() from the shutdown path which removes the IOMMU groups with no coordination whatsoever with their users - shutdown methods are optional in device drivers. This can lead to NULL pointer dereferences in those drivers' DMA API calls or worse.  Instead of calling the full arm_smmu_device_remove() from arm_smmu_device_shutdown() let's pick only the relevant function call - arm_smmu_device_disable() - more or less the reverse of arm_smmu_device_reset() - and call just that from the shutdown path.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2022-0866,This is a concurrency issue that can result in the wrong caller principal being returned from the session context of an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal. In particular the org.jboss.as.ejb3.component.EJBComponent class has an incomingRunAsIdentity field. This field is used by the org.jboss.as.ejb3.security.RunAsPrincipalInterceptor to keep track of the current identity prior to switching to a new identity created using the RunAs principal. The exploit consist that the EJBComponent#incomingRunAsIdentity field is currently just a SecurityIdentity. This means in a concurrent environment where multiple users are repeatedly invoking an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal it's possible for the wrong the caller principal to be returned from EJBComponent#getCallerPrincipal. Similarly it's also possible for EJBComponent#isCallerInRole to return the wrong value. Both of these methods rely on incomingRunAsIdentity. Affects all versions of JBoss EAP from 7.1.0 and all versions of WildFly 11+ when Elytron is enabled.,5.3,CWE-863
CVE-2022-35936,Ethermint is an Ethereum library. In Ethermint running versions before `v0.17.2` the contract `selfdestruct` invocation permanently removes the corresponding bytecode from the internal database storage. However due to a bug in the `DeleteAccount`function all contracts that used the identical bytecode (i.e shared the same `CodeHash`) will also stop working once one contract invokes `selfdestruct` even though the other contracts did not invoke the `selfdestruct` OPCODE. This vulnerability has been patched in Ethermint version v0.18.0. The patch has state machine-breaking changes for applications using Ethermint so a coordinated upgrade procedure is required. A workaround is available. If a contract is subject to DoS due to this issue the user can redeploy the same contract i.e. with identical bytecode so that the original contract's code is recovered. The new contract deployment restores the `bytecode hash -> bytecode` entry in the internal state.,8.2,CWE-668

CVE-2024-5211,A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read delete or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage' directory such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise denial of service (DoS) attacks and unauthorized admin account takeover.

CVE-2022-47631,Razer Synapse through 3.7.1209.121307 allows privilege escalation due to an unsafe installation path and improper privilege management. Attackers can place DLLs into %PROGRAMDATA%\Razer\Synapse3\Service\bin if they do so before the service is installed and if they deny write access for the SYSTEM user. Although the service will not start if it detects malicious DLLs in this directory attackers can exploit a race condition and replace a valid DLL (i.e. a copy of a legitimate Razer DLL) with a malicious DLL after the service has already checked the file. As a result local Windows users can abuse the Razer driver installer to obtain administrative privileges on Windows.,7.8,CWE-367

CVE-2024-21661,Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13 2.9.9 and 2.10.4 an attacker can exploit a critical flaw in the application to initiate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack rendering the application inoperable and affecting all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an array in a multi-threaded environment. The vulnerability is rooted in the application's code where an array is being modified while it is being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes critically unsafe when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When two threads interact with the same array simultaneously the application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any attacker can crash the application continuously making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service. The issue is exacerbated because it does not require authentication widening the pool of potential attackers. Versions 2.8.13 2.9.9 and 2.10.4 contain a patch for this issue.,7.5,CWE-787

CVE-2024-28181, turbo_boost-commands is a set of commands to help you build robust reactive applications with Rails & Hotwire. TurboBoost Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on Command classes can be invoked; however the existing checks aren't as robust as they should be. It's possible for a sophisticated attacker to invoke more methods than should be permitted depending on the the strictness of authorization checks that individual applications enforce. Being able to call some of these methods can have security implications. Commands verify that the class must be a `Command` and that the method requested is defined as a public method; however this isn't robust enough to guard against all unwanted code execution. The library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe before allowing them to be executed. This issue has been addressed in versions 0.1.3 and 0.2.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should see the repository GHSA for workaround advice.,8.1,CWE-74

CVE-2024-44951,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: sc16is7xx: fix TX fifo corruption  Sometimes when a packet is received on channel A at almost the same time as a packet is about to be transmitted on channel B we observe with a logic analyzer that the received packet on channel A is transmitted on channel B. In other words the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted with data from channel A.  The problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (serial: sc16is7xx: change EFR lock to operate on each channels) which changed the EFR locking to operate on each channel instead of chip-wise.  This commit has introduced a regression because the EFR lock is used not only to protect the EFR registers access but also in a very obscure and undocumented way to protect access to the data buffer which is shared by the Tx and Rx handlers but also by each channel of the IC.  Fix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in sc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.  Secondly replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for each channel.,7.8,CWE-667
