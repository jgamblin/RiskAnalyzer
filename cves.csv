CVE-2024-56662,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctl  Fix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:  BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/ core.c:416 [inline] BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0 drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459  The issue occurs in cmd_to_func when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2 array is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to a buffer that is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can lead to out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does not have sufficient space.  To address this a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure that buf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg) before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members of call_pkg including the nd_reserved2 array.,6.0,CWE-125

CVE-2024-47538,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the `vorbis_handle_identification_packet` function within `gstvorbisdec.c`. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd->vi.channels exceeds 64 the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array. The value written will always be `GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE`. This vulnerability allows someone to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally this bug can overwrite the `GstAudioInfo` info structure. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.,9.8,CWE-121
CVE-2023-1472,The RapidLoad Power-Up for Autoptimize plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to and including 1.7.1.

CVE-2024-27003,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: Get runtime PM before walking tree for clk_summary  Similar to the previous commit we should make sure that all devices are runtime resumed before printing the clk_summary through debugfs. Failure to do so would result in a deadlock if the thread is resuming a device to print clk state and that device is also runtime resuming in another thread e.g the screen is turning on and the display driver is starting up. We remove the calls to clk_pm_runtime_{getput}() in this path because they're superfluous now that we know the devices are runtime resumed. This also squashes a bug where the return value of clk_pm_runtime_get() wasn't checked leading to an RPM count underflow on error paths.,5.5,CWE-667

CVE-2025-62430,ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. ClipBucket v5 through build 5.5.2 #145 allows stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in multiple video and photo metadata fields. For videos the Tags field and the Genre Actors Producer Executive Producer and Director fields in Movieinfos accept user supplied values without adequate sanitization. For photos the Photo Title and Photo Tags fields accept user supplied values without adequate sanitization. A regular user who can edit a video or photo can inject script (for example by supplying a value such as a closing delimiter followed by a script element). The injected script executes when any user including an unauthenticated visitor or an administrator views the affected video or photo page. Although cookies are set with the HttpOnly attribute and cannot be read directly the injected script can issue fetch requests to endpoints such as admin_area pages and exfiltrate their contents or trigger unintended actions. Version 5.5.2 build #146 and later contain a fix. Update to build 5.5.2 #146 or later. No known workarounds exist.,5.4,CWE-79

CVE-2025-61590,Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Versions 1.6 and below are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks through Visual Studio Code Workspaces. Workspaces allow users to open more than a single folder and save specific settings (pretty similar to .vscode/settings.json) for the folders / project. An untitled workspace is automatically created by VS Code (untitled.code-workspace) which contains all the folders and workspace settings from the user's current session opening up an entire new attack vector if the user has a .code-workspace file in path (either untitled created automatically or a saved one). If an attacker is able to hijack the chat context of the victim (such as via a compromised MCP server) they can use prompt injection to make the Cursor Agent write into this file and modify the workspace. This leads to a bypass of CVE-2025-54130 which can lead to RCE by writing to the settings section. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.,7.5,CWE-94
