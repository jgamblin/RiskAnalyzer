CVE-2023-21797,Microsoft ODBC Driver Remote Code Execution Vulnerability,8.8,CWE-190
CVE-2024-1881,AutoGPT a component of significant-gravitas/autogpt is vulnerable to an improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') due to a flaw in its shell command validation function.

Impact: Critical â The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user and can arbitrarily add modify and deletefiles and services.  CVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L) nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated but the level of authentication does not matter (PR:L) nor is any user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a full compromised (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H) and compromised devices can be used to pivot into networks that should potentially not be accessible (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power there is a potential safety impact (S:P). This attack can be automated (AU:Y).,8.8,CWE-78

CVE-2023-30622,Clusternet is a general-purpose system for controlling Kubernetes clusters across different environments. An issue in clusternet prior to version 0.15.2 can be leveraged to lead to a cluster-level privilege escalation. The clusternet has a deployment called `cluster-hub` inside the `clusternet-system` Kubernetes namespace which runs on worker nodes randomly. The deployment has a service account called `clusternet-hub` which has a cluster role called `clusternet:hub` via cluster role binding. The `clusternet:hub` cluster role has `* verbs of *.*` resources. Thus if a malicious user can access the worker node which runs the clusternet they can leverage the service account to do malicious actions to critical system resources. For example the malicious user can leverage the service account to get ALL secrets in the entire cluster resulting in cluster-level privilege escalation. Version 0.15.2 contains a fix for this issue.,6.7,CWE-269
CVE-2023-30798,There MultipartParser usage in Encode's Starlette python framework before versions 0.25.0 allows an unauthenticated and remote attacker to specify any number of form fields or files which can cause excessive memory usage resulting in denial of service of the HTTP service.,7.5,CWE-400

CVE-2023-28096,OpenSIPS a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation has a memory leak starting in the 2.3 branch and priot to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5. The memory leak was detected in the function `parse_mi_request` while performing coverage-guided fuzzing. This issue can be reproduced by sending multiple requests of the form `{jsonrpc: 2.0method: log_le`. This malformed message was tested against an instance of OpenSIPS via FIFO transport layer and was found to increase the memory consumption over time.  To abuse this memory leak attackers need to reach the management interface (MI) which typically should only be exposed on trusted interfaces. In cases where the MI is exposed to the internet without authentication abuse of this issue will lead to memory exhaustion which may affect the underlying systemâs availability. No authentication is typically required to reproduce this issue. On the other hand memory leaks may occur in other areas of OpenSIPS where the cJSON library is used for parsing JSON objects.  The issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.,4.5,CWE-401

CVE-2024-53259,quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO the kernel would then return a message too large error on sendmsg i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC) the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially this can be done after completion of the handshake thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.,6.5,CWE-345
