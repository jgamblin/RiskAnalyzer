CVE-2023-49284,fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS Linux and the rest of the family. fish shell uses certain Unicode non-characters internally for marking wildcards and expansions. It will incorrectly allow these markers to be read on command substitution output rather than transforming them into a safe internal representation. While this may cause unexpected behavior with direct input (for example echo \UFDD2HOME has the same output as echo $HOME) this may become a minor security problem if the output is being fed from an external program into a command substitution where this output may not be expected. This design flaw was introduced in very early versions of fish predating the version control system and is thought to be present in every version of fish released in the last 15 years or more although with different characters. Code execution does not appear to be possible but denial of service (through large brace expansion) or information disclosure (such as variable expansion) is potentially possible under certain circumstances. fish shell 3.6.2 has been released to correct this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.,3.9,CWE-436

CVE-2024-36479,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fpga: bridge: add owner module and take its refcount  The current implementation of the fpga bridge assumes that the low-level module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the bridge if the parent device does not have a driver.  To address this problem add a module owner pointer to the fpga_bridge struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the function for registering a bridge to take an additional owner module parameter and rename it to avoid conflicts. Use the old function name for a helper macro that automatically sets the module that registers the bridge as the owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and reduces the chances of registering a bridge without setting the owner.  Also update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface for registering an fpga bridge.  Other changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_bridge_get() to fpga_bridge_get() and of_fpga_bridge_get() to improve code clarity since the bridge device is taken in these functions.,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-42240,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation  When BHI mitigation is enabled if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set then entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the clear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler (exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the entry_SYSENTER_compat() function.  To address this issue entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY after making sure the TF flag is cleared.  The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:    $ cat sysenter_step.c   int main()   { asm(pushf; pop %ax; bts $8%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter); }    $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c    $ ./sysenter_step   Segmentation fault (core dumped)  The program is expected to crash and the #DB handler will issue a warning.
