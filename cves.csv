CVE-2023-25577,Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version 2.2.3 Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data` `request.form` `request.files` or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)` it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously this can exhaust or kill all available workers. Version 2.2.3 contains a patch for this issue.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2023-48220,Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version 0.4.rc3 and prior to version 2.0.9 of the `devise_invitable` gem the invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited amount of time through the password reset functionality. This issue creates vulnerable dependencies starting in version 0.0.1.alpha3 and prior to versions 0.26.9 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 of the `decidim` `decidim-admin` and `decidim-system` gems. When using the password reset functionality the `devise_invitable` gem always accepts the pending invitation if the user has been invited. The only check done is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for` expiry period. Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this configuration should be respected. The bug is in the `devise_invitable` gem and should be fixed there and the dependency should be upgraded in Decidim once the fix becomes available. `devise_invitable` to version `2.0.9` and above fix this issue. Versions 0.26.9 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 of the `decidim` `decidim-admin` and `decidim-system` gems contain this fix. As a workaround invitations can be cancelled directly from the database.,5.7,CWE-672

CVE-2024-52581,Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to version 2.13.0 the multipart form parser shipped with litestar expects the entire request body as a single byte string and there is no default limit for the total size of the request body. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large files wrapped in a `multipart/form-data` request and cause excessive memory consumption on the server. The multipart form parser in affected versions is vulnerable to this type of attack by design. The public method signature as well as its implementation both expect the entire request body to be available as a single byte string. It is not possible to accept large file uploads in a safe way using this parser. This may be a regression as a variation of this issue was already reported in CVE-2023-25578. Limiting the part number is not sufficient to prevent out-of-memory errors on the server. A patch is available in version 2.13.0.,7.5,CWE-770

CVE-2024-28121,stimulus_reflex is a system to extend the capabilities of both Rails and Stimulus by intercepting user interactions and passing them to Rails over real-time websockets. In affected versions more methods than expected can be called on reflex instances. Being able to call some of them has security implications. To invoke a reflex a websocket message of the following shape is sent: `\target\:\[class_name]#[method_name]\\args\:[]`. The server will proceed to instantiate `reflex` using the provided `class_name` as long as it extends `StimulusReflex::Reflex`. It then attempts to call `method_name` on the instance with the provided arguments. This is problematic as `reflex.method method_name` can be more methods that those explicitly specified by the developer in their reflex class. A good example is the instance_variable_set method. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 3.4.2 and 3.5.0.rc4. Users unable to upgrade should: see the backing GHSA advisory for mitigation advice.,8.8,CWE-470

CVE-2022-29219,Lodestar is a TypeScript implementation of the Ethereum Consensus specification. Prior to version 0.36.0 there is a possible consensus split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain. Because the developers represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s there is an issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain. In those cases Lodestar may view valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as invalid due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus split where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network. Similarly Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as valid thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases so one may carefully use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus.,7.5,CWE-190
