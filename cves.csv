CVE-2024-23953,Use of Arrays.equals() in LlapSignerImpl in Apache Hive to compare message signatures allows attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. The attacker should be an authorized user of the product to perform this attack. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0 which fixes this issue.  The problem occurs when an application doesn’t use a constant-time algorithm for validating a signature. The method Arrays.equals() returns false right away when it sees that one of the input’s bytes are different. It means that the comparison time depends on the contents of the arrays. This little thing may allow an attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. So it might allow malicious users to submit splits/work with selected signatures to LLAP without running as a privileged user potentially leading to DDoS attack.

However the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51 10.0.14 and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set to a non-negative value so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).,5.3,CWE-400

CVE-2024-56631,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: sg: Fix slab-use-after-free read in sg_release()  Fix a use-after-free bug in sg_release() detected by syzbot with KASAN:  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in lock_release+0x151/0xa30 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5838 __mutex_unlock_slowpath+0xe2/0x750 kernel/locking/mutex.c:912 sg_release+0x1f4/0x2e0 drivers/scsi/sg.c:407  In sg_release() the function kref_put(&sfp->f_ref sg_remove_sfp) is called before releasing the open_rel_lock mutex. The kref_put() call may decrement the reference count of sfp to zero triggering its cleanup through sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work via sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() which ultimately frees sfp.  After kref_put() sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may reference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed this results in a slab-use-after-free error.  Move the kref_put(&sfp->f_ref sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the open_rel_lock mutex. This ensures:   - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is    decremented.   - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and    sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the    mutex handling in sg_release().  The fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the bug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper sequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations eliminating the risk of use-after-free errors in sg_release().,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2023-48703,RobotsAndPencils go-saml a SAML client library written in Go contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in all known versions. This is due to how the `xmlsec1` command line tool is called internally to verify the signature of SAML assertions. When `xmlsec1` is used without defining the enabled key data the origin of the public key for the signature verification is unfortunately not restricted. That means an attacker can sign the SAML assertions themselves and provide the required public key (e.g. an RSA key) directly embedded in the SAML token. Projects still using RobotsAndPencils/go-saml should move to another SAML library or alternatively remove support for SAML from their projects. The vulnerability can likely temporarily be fixed by forking the go-saml project and adding the command line argument `--enabled-key-data` and specifying a value such as `x509` or `raw-x509-cert` when calling the `xmlsec1` binary in the verify function. Please note that this workaround must be carefully tested before it can be used.,7.5,CWE-287

CVE-2025-11244,The Password Protected plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass via IP address spoofing in all versions up to and including 2.7.11. This is due to the plugin trusting client-controlled HTTP headers (such as X-Forwarded-For HTTP_CLIENT_IP and similar headers) to determine user IP addresses in the `pp_get_ip_address()` function when the Use transients feature is enabled. This makes it possible for attackers to bypass authorization by spoofing these headers with the IP address of a legitimately authenticated user granted the Use transients option is enabled (non-default configuration) and the site is not behind a CDN or reverse proxy that overwrites these headers.,3.7,CWE-285

CVE-2025-29770,vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. The outlines library is one of the backends used by vLLM to support structured output (a.k.a. guided decoding). Outlines provides an optional cache for its compiled grammars on the local filesystem. This cache has been on by default in vLLM. Outlines is also available by default through the OpenAI compatible API server. The affected code in vLLM is vllm/model_executor/guided_decoding/outlines_logits_processors.py which unconditionally uses the cache from outlines. A malicious user can send a stream of very short decoding requests with unique schemas resulting in an addition to the cache for each request. This can result in a Denial of Service if the filesystem runs out of space. Note that even if vLLM was configured to use a different backend by default it is still possible to choose outlines on a per-request basis using the guided_decoding_backend key of the extra_body field of the request. This issue applies only to the V0 engine and is fixed in 0.8.0.,6.5,CWE-770
