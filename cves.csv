CVE-2024-56755,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING  In fscache_create_volume() there is a missing memory barrier between the bit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause a situation where after a wake-up the bit-clearing operation hasn't been detected yet leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is as follows:    [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work] fscache_perform_lookup   fscache_create_volume                         fscache_perform_lookup                           fscache_create_volume 			                        fscache_create_volume_work                                                   cachefiles_acquire_volume                                                   clear_and_wake_up_bit     test_and_set_bit                             test_and_set_bit                               goto maybe_wait       goto no_wait  In the above process cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1 enters the -no_wait- process it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting process. If a barrier is missing it may cause cookie2 to remain in the -wait- process indefinitely.  In commit 3288666c7256 (fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in fscache_create_volume_work()) barriers were added to similar operations in fscache_create_volume_work() but fscache_create_volume() was missed.  By combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to fix this issue.,5.5,CWE-401

CVE-2025-27145,copyparty a portable file server has a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in versions prior to 1.16.15. The vulnerability is considered low-risk. By handing someone a maliciously-named file and then tricking them into dragging the file into copyparty's Web-UI an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript with the same privileges as that user. For example this could give unintended read-access to files owned by that user. The bug is triggered by the drag-drop action itself; it is not necessary to actually initiate the upload. The file must be empty (zero bytes). Note that as a general-purpose webserver it is intentionally possible to upload HTML-files with arbitrary javascript in `<script>` tags which will execute when the file is opened. The difference is that this vulnerability would trigger execution of javascript during the act of uploading and not when the uploaded file was opened. Version 1.16.15 contains a fix.,3.6,CWE-79

CVE-2024-50271,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  signal: restore the override_rlimit logic  Prior to commit d64696905554 (Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of ucounts) UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally even if override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.    For example if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV signal sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the signal delivery preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo.  This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and handling the error.  From the user-space perspective applications are unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes as we observed with java applications.  Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively restores the old behavior.,5.5,CWE-770
