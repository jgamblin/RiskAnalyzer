CVE-2021-47357,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  atm: iphase: fix possible use-after-free in ia_module_exit()  This module's remove path calls del_timer(). However that function does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function has finished which would result in a use-after-free.  Fix by calling del_timer_sync() which makes sure the timer handler has finished and unable to re-schedule itself.,7.8,CWE-416

CVE-2022-23087,The e1000 network adapters permit a variety of modifications to an Ethernet packet when it is being transmitted.  These include the insertion of IP and TCP checksums insertion of an Ethernet VLAN header and TCP segmentation offload (TSO).  The e1000 device model uses an on-stack buffer to generate the modified packet header when simulating these modifications on transmitted packets.  When checksum offload is requested for a transmitted packet the e1000 device model used a guest-provided value to specify the checksum offset in the on-stack buffer.  The offset was not validated for certain packet types.  A misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve process on the host possibly leading to code execution in the host context.  The bhyve process runs in a Capsicum sandbox which (depending on the FreeBSD version and bhyve configuration) limits the impact of exploiting this issue.,8.8,CWE-787

CVE-2022-22167,A traffic classification vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on the SRX Series Services Gateways may allow an attacker to bypass Juniper Deep Packet Inspection (JDPI) rules and access unauthorized networks or resources when 'no-syn-check' is enabled on the device. While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy which is more permissive causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

CVE-2022-34770,Tabit - sensitive information disclosure. Several APIs on the web system display without authorization sensitive information such as health statements previous bills in a specific restaurant alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API’s has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However they each receive a ‘tiny URL’ in Tabit’s domain in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.,4.6,CWE-639

CVE-2022-24770,`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11 `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file then it automatically runs these commands which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11` which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.,8.8,CWE-1236

CVE-2023-52767,In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: fix NULL deref on tls_sw_splice_eof() with empty record  syzkaller discovered that if tls_sw_splice_eof() is executed as part of sendfile() when the plaintext/ciphertext sk_msg are empty the send path gets confused because the empty ciphertext buffer does not have enough space for the encryption overhead. This causes tls_push_record() to go on the `split = true` path (which is only supposed to be used when interacting with an attached BPF program) and then get further confused and hit the tls_merge_open_record() path which then assumes that there must be at least one populated buffer element leading to a NULL deref.  It is possible to have empty plaintext/ciphertext buffers if we previously bailed from tls_sw_sendmsg_locked() via the tls_trim_both_msgs() path. tls_sw_push_pending_record() already handles this case correctly; let's do the same check in tls_sw_splice_eof().,5.5,CWE-476

CVE-2024-47616,Pomerium is an identity and context-aware access proxy. The Pomerium databroker service is responsible for managing all persistent Pomerium application state.
